From this, we can geometrically prove a useful inequality relation between complex numbers, called the \"triangle inequality\": $$|z_1 + z_2| \\le |z_1| + |z_2|.$$\n",

In particular, multiplication by $e^{i\\theta}$ is equivalent to a rotation by angle $\\theta$.\n",

    "## Why complex numbers?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a question that might have occurred to you: if we extend the concept of numbers to complex numbers, why stop here? Why not extend the concept further, and formulate other number systems even more complicated than complex numbers?\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have seen, complex numbers are appealing mathematical objects because they can be manipulated via the same rules of algebra as real numbers. We can add, subtract, multiply, and divide them without running into any logical inconsistencies. One difference is that [complex numbers cannot be ordered](#ordering) (i.e., complex algebra only involves equations, not inequality relations), but this is not a serious limitation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complex numbers are, in a sense, the natural mathematical setting for doing algebra. Arguably, they are even more advantageous than the real numbers for doing algebra because, unlike the real numbers, they are **algebraically closed**, meaning that all complex polynomial equations have solutions in $\\mathbb{C}$. The real numbers lack this property: there are real algebraic equations with no solution in $\\mathbb{R}$, like $x^2 + 1 = 0$.  The algebraic closure of $\\mathbb{C}$ is called the [Fundamental Theorem of Algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_algebra), which gives an idea of its importance (but we won't delve into the details in this course). One consequence of this is that $\\mathbb{C}$ cannot be generalized to a more complicated number system via the same [route](#imaginary) used to extend $\\mathbb{R}$ into $\\mathbb{C}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is possible to formulate number systems more complicated than the complex numbers, by discarding one or more of the usual rules of algebra.  The [quaternions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion) are a system of four-component numbers obeying an algebra that is non-commutative (i.e., $ab = ba$ is not generally true).  The [octonions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octonion) are a yet more complicated system of eight-component numbers which are not only non-commutative but also non-associative (i.e., $(ab)c = a(bc)$ is not generally true).  These and other number systems are occasionally useful in physics and other fields, but overall they are vastly less important than $\\mathbb{C}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "One major reason for the usefulness of complex numbers, compared to quaternions and octonions, is that it's relatively easy to formulate a complex version of calculus. The concepts of derivatives and integrals, which are defined using algebraic limit expressions, can be more-or-less directly applied to complex functions, leading to the subject of **complex analysis**. [As we shall see later in the course](07_complex_derivatives.ipynb), complex analysis has important implications for *real* calculus; for instance, many real integrals can be easily solved by first generalizing them into complex integrals.  By contrast, since quaternions and octonions are not commutative, the very concept of a derivative is tricky to formulate in those number systems."
