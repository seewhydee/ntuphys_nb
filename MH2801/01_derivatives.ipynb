    "\n",
    "Second, limits obey a product rule and a quotient rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\\lim_{x \\rightarrow c} \\big[\\;f_1(x) \\; f_2(x)\\;\\big] &= \\Big[\\lim_{x \\rightarrow c} f_1(x)\\Big]\\;\\Big[\\lim_{x \\rightarrow c} f_2(x)\\Big]  \\\\ \\lim_{x \\rightarrow c} \\left[\\;\\frac{f_1(x)}{f_2(x)}\\;\\right] &= \\frac{\\lim_{x \\rightarrow c} f_1(x)}{\\lim_{x \\rightarrow c} f_2(x)}. \\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As a special exception, the product rule and quotient rule are inapplicable if they result in $0 \\times \\infty$, $\\infty/\\infty$, or $0/0$, which are undefined. As an example of why such combinations are problematic, consider this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\lim_{x \\rightarrow 0} \\;x = \\lim_{x \\rightarrow 0}\\Big[\\,x^2\\;\\frac{1}{x}\\;\\Big] \\overset{?}{=} \\lim_{x \\rightarrow 0}\\Big[\\,x^2\\,\\Big]\\; \\lim_{x \\rightarrow 0}\\Big[\\,\\frac{1}{x}\\,\\Big] = 0 \\, \\times \\, \\infty \\;\\;(??)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, the true value of the limit expression is 0; the second step was incorrect, since it involved an attempt to apply the product rule where it is inapplicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is often convenient to use the computer to check for the correctness of a limit expression. This can be done by replacing infinitesimal quantities with numbers that are nonzero but very small.  For example, here is a quick way to check that the derivative of $x^2 + 1$ is $2x$:"
