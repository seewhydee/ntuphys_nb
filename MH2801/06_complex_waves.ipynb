    "## The wave equation\n",
    "\n",
    "A wave can be described by a function $f(x,t)$, called a **wavefunction**, which specifies the value of some physical quantity at each position $x$ and time $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, let us focus on the case of one spatial dimension, for which $x$ is a single real number. We will also assume that the value of the wavefunction is a number, rather than a more complicated object such as a vector. For instance, a sound wave can be described by a wavefunction whose value $f(x,t)$ is the local air pressure at position $x$ and time $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The wavefunction obeys a [partial differential equation](02_derivatives.ipynb#PDE) (PDE) called the **time-dependent wave equation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{1}{v^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial t^2}, \\;\\;\\; v \\in\\mathbb{R}^+.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameter $v$, which we take to be a positive real constant, is called the **wave speed**, for reasons that will shortly become clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, we write the wave equation in the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} - \\frac{1}{v^2} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial t^2}\\right) \\; f(x,t) = 0.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This consists of a linear differential operator acting on $f(x,t)$, which emphasizes that the wave equation is a linear PDE. Hence, any linear superposition of solutions is also a solution."
