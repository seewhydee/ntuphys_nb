    "# 7. Branch Points and Branch Cuts\n",
    "\n",
    "When [introducing complex algebra](03_complex_numbers.ipynb), we postponed discussion of what it means to raise a complex number to a non-integer power, such as $z^{1/2}$, $z^{4/3}$, or $z^{\\pi}$. It is now time to open that can of worms.  This will involve two important new concepts: **branch points** and **branch cuts**.\n",

    "Given a complex number in its [polar representation](03_complex_numbers.ipynb#polar), $z = r\\exp[i\\theta]$, raising to the power of $p$ could be handled this way:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$z^p = \\left(re^{i\\theta}\\right)^p = r^p e^{ip\\theta}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a closer look at the complex exponential term $e^{ip\\theta}$.  Since $\\theta = \\mathrm{arg}(z)$ is an angle, we can change it by any integer multiple of $2\\pi$ without altering the value of $z$.  Taking this into account, we can re-write the above equation more carefully as\n",

    "Thus, there is an ambiguous factor of $\\exp(2\\pi i n p)$, where $n$ can be any integer. If $p$ is an integer, there is no problem, since $2\\pi n p$ will be an integer multiple of $2\\pi$, so $z^p$ has the same value regardless of $n$:\n",

In that case, \"raising to the power of $p$\" is a **multi-valued operation**. It cannot be treated as a function in the usual sense, since [functions must have unambiguous outputs](00_mathfunctions.ipynb)."

Observe that $f_+(z)$ lies just above the positive real axis, and $f_-(z)$ lies just below the negative real axis.  Next, change the argument to $\\mathrm{arg}(z) = 6.2$, so that $z$ lies just below the branch cut.  This is equivalent to a small downwards displacement of $z$, \"crossing\" the branch cut.  Observe that $f_-(z)$ now lies just below the positive real axis, near where $f_+(z)$ was previously, and $f_+(z)$ now lies just above the negative real axis where $f_-(z)$ was previously.

As you vary the choice of the branch cut, observe that this affects which values of the multi-valued operation are assigned to the $+$ (orange) branch, and which values are assigned to the $-$ (blue) branch.

Thus, for complex numbers it does not make sense to define \"positive infinity\" and \"negative infinity\" as distinct entities. Instead, we work with a single complex $\\infty$.\n",
