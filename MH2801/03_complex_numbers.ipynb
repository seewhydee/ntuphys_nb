If $\\gamma$ and $\\omega$ are both positive, then the trajectory is an anticlockwise spiral moving outwards from the origin.  You should work out for yourself how and why the trajectory behaves if we flip the signs of $\\gamma$ and/or $\\omega$."

    "## Why complex numbers? (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "You may wonder what makes the square root of $-1$ an interesting mathematical object, such that it's used to define a whole new system of \"complex numbers\". You may also wonder whether complex numbers are the only generalization of real numbers; could the concept be usefully extended to even more complicated number systems?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer these questions, let's return to our earlier observation that complex numbers can be manipulated using the same rules of algebra as real numbers. We can add, subtract, multiply, and divide (apart from division by zero) complex numbers, without running into any inconsistencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The set of complex numbers $\\mathbb{C}$ turns out to have a special property: it is ''algebraically closed'', meaning that every complex polynomial equation has solution(s) in $\\mathbb{C}$.  The set of real numbers, $\\mathbb{R}$, lacks this property, since equations like $x^2 + 1 = 0$ have no solution in $\\mathbb{R}$ (this was the motivation for introducing the imaginary unit in the first place).  The \"closure\" property of $\\mathbb{C}$ is so important that it's called the [Fundamental Theorem of Algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_algebra).  The Fundamental Theorem implies that $\\mathbb{C}$ can't be \"algebraically extended\" into a more complicated number system the way we extended $\\mathbb{R}$ into $\\mathbb{C}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "There do exist extensions of complex numbers that discard one or more of the rules of algebra.  The [quaternions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion) are a kind of number system where each quaternionic number has four real components; these obey a non-commutative algebra where, generally, $ab \\ne ba$.  [Octonions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octonion) are eight-component numbers which are both non-commutative and non-associative: $(ab)c \\ne a(bc)$.  These and other still-more-complicated number systems have some applications in physics and other fields, but are overall much less important than $\\mathbb{C}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another reason complex numbers are so mathematically rich is that you can do calculus on them.  The study of smooth complex functions is called **complex analysis**, which will be discussed [later](complex_derivatives.ipynb).  As we shall see, it is possible to extend the concepts of differentiation and integration from real functions to complex functions, with many profound outcomes.  By contrast, because quaternions are not commutative, even the concept of \"derivative\" becomes tricky to define. Thus, it's a lot harder to perform mathematical analysis on quaternions and other more complicated number systems."
