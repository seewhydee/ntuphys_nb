    "# 5. Complex Waves\n",

    "## The wave equation\n",
    "\n",
    "A wave can be described by a function $f(x,t)$, called a **wavefunction**, which specifies the value of a measurable physical quantity at each position $x$ and time $t$. For simplicity, we will assume that space is one-dimensional, so $x$ is a single real number. We will also assume that $f(x,t)$ is a number, rather than a more complicated object such as a vector. For instance, a sound wave can be described by a wavefunction $f(x,t)$ representing the air pressure at each point of space and time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The evolution of the wavefunction is described by a [partial differential equation](01_derivatives.ipynb#PDE) (PDE) called the **time-dependent wave equation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{1}{v^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial t^2}, \\;\\;\\; v \\in\\mathbb{R}^+.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameter $v$, which we take to be a positive real constant, is called the **wave speed**, for reasons that will shortly become clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, we re-arrange the wave equation into the following form, consisting of a linear differential operator acting on $f(x,t)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} - \\frac{1}{v^2} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial t^2}\\right) \\; f(x,t) = 0.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This way of writing the wave equation emphasizes that it is a linear PDE, meaning that any linear superposition of solutions is likewise a solution."

If, together with this time shift, we change $x$ by $\\delta x = (\\omega/k)\\, \\delta t$, then the change in the $kx$ term and the change in the $\\omega t$ term cancel, leaving the value of the cosine unchanged:\n",
