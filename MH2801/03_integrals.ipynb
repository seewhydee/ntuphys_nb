    "1. Consider the step function $$\\Theta(x) = \\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll} 1, &\\;\\;\\;\\textrm{for} \\; x \\ge 0\\\\ 0,&\\;\\;\\; \\textrm{otherwise.}\\end{array}\\right.$$ Write down an expression for the antiderivative of $\\Theta(x)$, and sketch its graph.\n",
    "2. Show that<br/>$$\\int_0^{2\\pi} dx\\, [\\sin(x)]^2 = \\int_0^{2\\pi} dx\\, [\\cos(x)]^2 = \\pi.$$\n",
    "3. Calculate the following definite integrals:\n",
    "    1. $\\displaystyle\\int_{0}^\\pi dx\\; x^2 \\sin(2x)$\n",
    "    2. $\\displaystyle\\int_{1}^\\alpha dx\\; x \\ln(x)$\n",
    "    3. $\\displaystyle\\int_0^\\infty dx\\;e^{-\\gamma x} \\, \\cos(x)$\n",
    "    4. $\\displaystyle\\int_0^\\infty dx\\;e^{-\\gamma x} \\, x \\cos(x)$\n",
    "    5. $\\displaystyle\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty dx\\;e^{-\\gamma |x|}$\n",
    "    6. $\\displaystyle \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty dx \\;e^{-|x+1|} \\sin(x)$\n",
    "4. By differentiating under the integral, solve $$\\int_0^1 dx\\; \\frac{x^2-1}{\\ln(x)}.$$ Hint: replace $x^2$ in the numerator with $x^\\gamma$. [(Solution)](12_solutions.ipynb#03_04)\n",
    "5. Let $f(x,y)$ be a function that depends on two inputs $x$ and $y$, and define $$I(x) = \\int_0^x f(x,y) dy.$$ \n",
    "Using the [definition of the derivative](02_derivatives.ipynb), prove that $$\\frac{dI}{dx} = f(x,y) + \\int_0^x \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(x,y) \\;dy.$$\n",
    "6. Consider the ordinary differential equation $$\\frac{dy}{dt} = - \\gamma y(t) + f(t),$$ where $\\gamma > 0$ and $f(t)$ is some function of $t$. The solution can be written in the form $$y(t) = y(0) + \\int_0^t dt' \\, e^{-\\gamma(t-t')} \\, g(t').$$ Find the appropriate function $g$, in terms of $f$ and $y(0)$. [(Solution)](12_solutions.ipynb#03_06)\n",
    "7. Use [numerical integration](#numerical_integration) to check the value of the Gaussian integral [derived analytically above](#gaussian_integral). Note that it's impossible to perform a numerical integral over an infinite range, so you must pick a range that is appropriately large.\n",
    "8. Use [numerical integration](#numerical_integration) to check the value of the integral $$\\int_{0}^\\infty dx \\, \\sin(x)/x = \\pi/2$$ derived [above](#diff_integral).  Note that the integrand is divergent at $x=0$, so you should adjust the lower bound of the numerical integral to some positive but appropriately small value.\n"
