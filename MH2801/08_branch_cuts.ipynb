Observe that $f_+(z)$ lies just above the positive real axis, and $f_-(z)$ lies just below the negative real axis.  Next, change the argument to $\\mathrm{arg}(z) = 6.2$, so that $z$ lies just below the branch cut.  This is equivalent to a small downwards displacement of $z$, \"crossing\" the branch cut.  Now, the values of the positive and negative branches are swapped: $f_-(z)$ lies just below the positive real axis, near where $f_+(z)$ was previously, and $f_+(z)$ now lies just above the negative real axis where $f_-(z)$ was previously.\n",

As you vary the choice of the branch cut, observe that this affects which values of the multi-valued operation are assigned to the $+$ (orange) branch, and which values are assigned to the $-$ (blue) branch.  Hence, the choice of branch cut is just a choice about how to divide up the branches of a multi-valued operation."
