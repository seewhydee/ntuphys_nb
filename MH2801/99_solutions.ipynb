To evaluate the loop integral, we need the poles of the integrand, which are the solutions to $z^4 = -1$. Writing $-1 = \\exp(i\\pi)$, we find that the roots are $\\exp(i\\pi/4) \\times \\{\\text{4-roots of unity}\\}.$ These can be written in the Cartesian representation as $$\\begin{align} z_1 &= \\frac{1+i}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ z_2 &= \\frac{-1+i}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ z_3 &= \\frac{-1-i}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ z_4 &= \\frac{1-i}{\\sqrt{2}}.\\end{align}$$ By closing the contour above, we enclose $z_1$ and $z_2$. Thus, by the residue theorem, $$\\begin{align}I &= 2\\pi i \\left\\{\\left[\\mathrm{Res} \\left(\\frac{1}{z^4 + 1}\\right)\\right]_{z=z_1} + \\left[\\mathrm{Res} \\left(\\frac{1}{z^4 + 1}\\right)\\right]_{z=z_2}\\right\\} \\\\ &= 2\\pi i\\left[\\frac{1}{(z_1-z_2)(z_1-z_3)(z_1-z_4)} + \\frac{1}{(z_2-z_1)(z_2-z_3)(z_2-z_4)}\\right] \\\\ &= 2\\pi i \\left[\\frac{\\sqrt{8}}{(2)(2+2i)(2i)} + \\frac{\\sqrt{8}}{(-2)(2i)(-2+2i)}\\right] \\\\ &= \\frac{\\sqrt{2}\\pi i}{2} \\left[\\frac{1}{-1+i} + \\frac{1}{1+i}\\right] \\\\ &= \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{2}}.\\end{align}$$\n",

    "A unit circle centered at the origin can be parameterized by $z = \\exp(i\\phi)$.  Hence, along this circle, $$\\begin{align}\\cos\\phi &= \\frac{1}{2}\\left(e^{i\\phi} + e^{-i\\phi}\\right) \\\\ &= \\frac{1}{2} \\left(e^{i\\phi} + \\frac{1}{e^{i\\phi}}\\right) \\\\ &= \\frac{1}{2}\\left(z + \\frac{1}{z}\\right).\\end{align}$$ Also, $$\\frac{dz}{d\\phi} = iz.$$ Let us denote this circular contour by $\\Gamma$. We want to find a function $f(z)$ such that $$\\oint_\\Gamma f(z) \\;dz = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\frac{d\\phi}{\\cos\\phi+3}.$$ The contour integral on the left side can be parameterized as $$\\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\phi\\; f\\big(z(\\phi)\\big)\\, \\frac{dz}{d\\phi}.$$ Therefore, we want $f(z)$ such that $$\\begin{align}f\\big(z(\\phi)\\big) \\frac{dz}{d\\phi} &= \\frac{1}{\\cos\\phi+3} \\\\ = f(z) \\;\\,(i z) &= \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2}\\left(z+\\frac{1}{z}\\right) + 3}.\\end{align}$$ After some algebra, we obtain $$f(z) = \\frac{-2i}{z^2 + 6z + 1}.$$ The denominator in $f(z)$ has two roots, which are both real: $$\\begin{align}z_+ &= -3 + 2\\sqrt{2} = - 0.17157\\dots \\\\ z_- &= -3 - 2\\sqrt{2} = -5.8284\\dots\\end{align}$$ Only the $z_+$ pole is enclosed by the unit circle. Thus, we can use the residue theorem to evaluate the integral: $$\\begin{align}I = \\oint_\\Gamma \\frac{-2i}{z^2 + 6z + 1} \\, dz &= 2\\pi i \\; \\mathrm{Res}\\left[\\frac{-2i}{(z-z_+)(z-z_-)}\\right]_{z = z_+} \\\\ &= 2\\pi i \\left(\\frac{-2i}{z_+-z_-}\\right) \\\\ &= \\frac{4\\pi}{\\left(-3 + 2\\sqrt{2}\\right)-\\left(-3 - 2\\sqrt{2}\\right)} \\\\ &= \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{2}}.\\end{align}$$\n",

    "The solution procedure is very similar to the <a href=\"08_contour_integration.ipynb#principal-value\">example worked out in the section of principal-value integrals</a>. From the properties of $f(z)$ given in the problem statement, we can conclude that (i) the integrand is analytic on and within the loop contour, so the residue theorem can be used; and (ii) the integrand vanishes quickly enough far from the origin so that, by Jordan's lemma, the integral over $\\Gamma_2$ vanishes. Hence, $$I = i \\pi f(a).$$ By relabelling the dummy variables $x \\rightarrow y$ and $a \\rightarrow x$, we can write $$f(x) = -\\frac{i}{\\pi} \\mathcal{P}\\left[\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac{f(y)}{y-x} dy \\right].$$ Let us now break up $f$ into its real and imaginary parts: $$\\begin{align}\\mathrm{Re}[f(x)] + i \\mathrm{Im}[f(x)] &= -\\frac{i}{\\pi} \\mathcal{P}\\left[\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac{\\mathrm{Re}[f(y)] + i \\mathrm{Im}[f(y)]}{y-x} \\;dy \\right] \\\\ &= \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\mathcal{P}\\left[\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac{\\mathrm{Im}[f(y)] -i\\mathrm{Re}[f(y)]}{y-x} \\;dy \\right].\\end{align}$$ Equating the real and imaginary parts of the two sides, we obtain the following two real equations, which are the Kramers-Kronig relations: $$\\begin{align}\\mathrm{Re}[f(x)] &= \\;\\;\\,\\frac{1}{\\pi} \\mathcal{P}\\left[\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac{\\mathrm{Im}[f(y)]}{y-x} \\;dy \\right] \\\\ \\mathrm{Im}[f(x)] &= -\\frac{1}{\\pi} \\mathcal{P}\\left[\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac{\\mathrm{Re}[f(y)]}{y-x} \\; dy \\right].\\end{align}$$\n",
