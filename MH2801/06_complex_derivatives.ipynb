    "6. Show that if $f(z = x + iy) = u(x,y) + i v(x,y)$ satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations, then the real functions $u$ and $v$ each obey Laplace's equation: $$\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2u}{\\partial y^2} = \\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial y^2} = 0.$$ (Such functions are called \"harmonic functions\".)\n",
    "7. We can write the real and imaginary parts of a function in terms of polar coordinates: $f(z) = u(r,\\theta) + i v(r,\\theta)$, where $z = re^{i\\theta}$.
