    "# 9. Fourier Series and Fourier Transforms\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Fourier transform** is one of the most important mathematical tools used for analyzing functions.  Given an arbitrary function $f(x)$, with a real domain ($x \\in \\mathbb{R}$), we can express it as a linear combination of complex waves.  The coefficients of the linear combination form a counterpart to $f$, which is a complex function $F(k)$ defined in a wave-number domain ($k \\in \\mathbb{R}$). Often, $F$ turns out to be easier to deal with than $f$. In particular, differential equations for $f$ can often be reduced to algebraic equations for $F$, which are much easier to solve."

    "We begin by discussing the **Fourier series**, which is used to analyze functions that are periodic in their inputs.  A **periodic function** $f(x)$ is a function of a real variable $x$ that repeats itself every time $x$ changes by $a$, as shown in the figure below:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The value of $f(x)$ can be real or complex, but $x$ should be real.  You can think of $x$ as representing a spatial coordinate. We can also think of the periodic function as being defined over a finite segment $-a/2 \\le x < a/2$, with periodic boundary conditions $f(-a/2) = f(a/2)$. In spatial terms, this is like wrapping the segment into a loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/periodic_ring.png\" alt=\"Interpretation of a periodic segment as a loop.\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider what it means to specify a periodic function $f(x)$. One way to specify the function is to give an explicit mathematical formula for it. Another approach might be to specify the function values in $-a/2 \\le x < a/2$. Since there's an uncountably infinite number of points in this domain, we can generally only achieve an approximate specification of $f$ this way, by giving the values of $f$ at a large but finite set $x$ points.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is another interesting approach to specifying $f$. We can express it as a linear combination of simpler periodic functions, consisting of [sines and cosines](#trigonometric):\n",

    "$$f(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\alpha_n \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi n x}{a}\\right) + \\sum_{m=0}^\\infty \\beta_m \\cos\\left(\\frac{2 \\pi m x}{a}\\right).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note that the $n$ index does not include 0; since the sine term with $n = 0$ vanishes for all $x$, it's redundant.) This is called a **Fourier series**. Given the numbers $\\{\\alpha_n, \\beta_m\\}$, which are called the **Fourier coefficients**, $f(x)$ can be calculated for any $x$. The Fourier coefficients are real if $f(x)$ is a real function, or complex if $f(x)$ is complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "The justification for the Fourier series formula is that the sine and cosine functions in the series are, themselves, periodic with period $a$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align}\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi n (x+a)}{a}\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi n x}{a} + 2\\pi n\\right) &= \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi n x}{a}\\right)\\\\ \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi m (x+a)}{a}\\right) = \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi m x}{a} + 2\\pi m\\right) &= \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi m x}{a}\\right).\\end{align}$$\n",

    "We can quantify the width of the Lorentzian by defining the **full-width at half-maximum** (FWHM)&mdash;the width of the curve at half the value of its maximum.  In this case, the maximum of the Lorentzian curve occurs at $k=0$ and has the value of $1/\\eta^2$.  The half-maximum, $1/2\\eta^2$, occurs when $\\delta k = \\pm \\eta$.  Hence, the original function's decay constant, $\\eta$, is directly proportional to the FWHM of the Fourier spectrum, which is $2\\eta$.\n",

    "Fourier transforms can be obtained numerically using a discretized form called the [Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform). DFTs are computed via an algorithm called the [Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform).  We will briefly describe how to run such calculations, without going into the underlying numerical details.\n",
    "\n",
    "To convert between a Fourier transform and a DFT, we first sample $f(x)$ at $N$ *equally-spaced* points $[x_0, x_1, \\dots, x_{N-1}]$ (note: by convention, the index starts from 0). The spacing is $\\Delta x = x_{j+1} - x_j$.  These gives an array of $N$ numbers, $[f_0, f_1, \\dots, f_{N-1}]$, where $f_j = f(x_j)$. By definition, the DFT consists of $N$ numbers $[F_0, F_1, \\dots, F_{N-1}]$ such that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F_n = \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} \\exp\\left(-2\\pi i \\frac{nj}{N}\\right)\\, f_j.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The DFT can be computed by calling [`scipy.fft.fft`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.fftpack.fft.html) with the $[f_0,\\dots,f_{N-1}]$ array as the input. After that, there are three more things we need to do to convert $[F_0, \\dots, F_{N-1}]$ into the values of the Fourier transform function $F(k)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We need the corresponding values of $k$. These can be obtained by calling [`scipy.fft.fftfreq`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.fftpack.fftfreq.html) with two inputs, $N$ and $\\Delta x$, and multiplying the result by $2\\pi$. This yields an array of $N$ numbers containing the values of $k$.\n",
    "2. We must re-arrange the arrays, since the $k$ values are not in monotonic order: the positive $k$'s are in the first half of the array, and the negative $k$'s are in the second half! (This is an artifact of the conventional definition of the DFT, which we will not go into.) To fix this, we call [`scipy.fft.fftshift`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.fftpack.fftshift.html), which takes an array and returns another array arranged in the appropriate (increasing-$k$) order. This must done for both the $F$ array and the $k$ array.\n",
    "3. Multiply the $F$ array by a scale factor $\\Delta x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting array contains the values of $F(k)$ at the specified values of $k$, *up to a constant phase factor* of the form $\\exp(i\\theta)$, where $\\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}$.  However, we normally only care about $|F(k)|^2$, so the phase factor doesn't need to be determined.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below show how to calculate numerical Fourier transforms according to the above steps, for the function discussed in the previously example.  The Fourier transform of this function was previously calculated to be $F(k) = -i/(k+i\\eta)$."

Of course, mathematical relations don't care about what kind of physical variable we are dealing with, so the same equations could be applied to functions of time $t$. However, there is a important difference in *convention*.  When dealing with functions of the time coordinate $t$, it is customary to use a different sign convention in the Fourier relations!\n",

    "3. If the Fourier transform of $f(x)$ is $F(k)$, then $$f^*(x) \\quad  \\overset{\\mathrm{FT}}{\\longrightarrow} \\;\\; F^*(-k).$$ As a consequence, the Fourier transform of a real function must satisfy the symmetry relation $F(k) = F^*(-k)$, meaning that the Fourier spectrum is symmetric about the origin in k-space: $\\big|\\,F(k)\\,\\big|^2 = \\big|\\,F(-k)\\,\\big|^2.$\n",
