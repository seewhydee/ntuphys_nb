    "The **Fourier transform** is one of the most important mathematical tools used for analyzing functions.  The basic idea is that an arbitrary function $f(x)$, with a real domain ($x \\in \\mathbb{R}$), can be expressed as a linear combination of more elementary functions (sinusoidal waves).  The coefficients of this linear combination form a counterpart function, $F(k)$, that is defined in a wave-number domain ($k \\in \\mathbb{R}$). As it turns out, it's often more convenient to deal with $F(k)$, because certain mathematical problems, such as differential equations, are easier to solve in the wave-number domain."

    "We begin by discussing the **Fourier series**, which is used to analyze functions which are periodic in their inputs.  A **periodic function** $f(x)$ is a function of a real variable $x$ that repeats itself every time $x$ changes by $a$, as shown in the figure below:\n",

    "$$f(x+a) = f(x), \\;\\; \\forall\\; x\\in \\mathbb{R}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of $f(x)$ can be real or complex, but $x$ should be real.  Another equivalent way to think of a periodic function is as a function defined over a finite domain $-a/2 \\le x < a/2$, with periodic boundary conditions $f(-a/2) = f(a/2)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of $x$ as representing a spatial coordinate. (The following mathematical discussion also applies to functions of time, with minor differences in convention that [we'll discuss later](#fourier_time).) \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider what it means to \"specify\" a periodic function $f(x)$. One way to specify the function is to give an explicit mathematical formula for it, but not all functions can be described by a formula. Another approach might be to specify the function values in $-a/2 \\le x < a/2$. Since there's an uncountably infinite number of points in this domain, we can generally only achieve an *approximate* specification of $f$ by giving the values of $f(x)$ for a large (but finite) set of $x$ points.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is another approximate method for specifying $f$ that is perhaps less obvious. We could express the function as a linear combination of simpler periodic functions, consisting of [sines and cosines](#trigonometric):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\alpha_n \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi n x}{a}\\right) + \\sum_{m=0}^\\infty \\beta_m \\cos\\left(\\frac{2 \\pi m x}{a}\\right).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called a **Fourier series**. Given a set of numbers $\\{\\alpha_n, \\beta_m\\}$, which are called the **Fourier coefficients**, we can calculate $f(x)$ for any $x$. The Fourier coefficients are real if $f(x)$ is a real function, or complex if $f(x)$ is complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "The justification for the Fourier series formula is that the sine and cosine functions in the series are, themselves, periodic with period $a$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align}\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi n (x+a)}{a}\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi n x}{a} + 2\\pi n\\right) &= \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi n x}{a}\\right)\\\\ \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi m (x+a)}{a}\\right) = \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi m x}{a} + 2\\pi m\\right) &= \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi m x}{a}\\right)\\end{align}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, any such linear combination automatically satisfies the periodicity condition for $f$. (Note that in the Fourier series formula, the sum over $n$ starts from 1, but the sum over $m$ starts from 0. This is because the sine term with $n = 0$ is zero for all $x$, so it's redundant.)"

    "We can quantify the width of the Lorentzian by defining the **full-width at half-maximum** (FWHM)&mdash;the width of the curve at half the value of its maximum.  In this case, the maximum of the Lorentzian curve occurs at $k=0$ and has the value of $1/\\eta^2$.  The half-maximum, $1/2\\eta^2$, occurs when $\\delta k = \\pm \\eta$.  Hence, the original function's decay constant, $\\eta$, is directly proportional to the FWHM of the Fourier spectrum, which is $2\\eta$.\n",

    "Fourier transforms can be obtained numerically using a discretized form called the [Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform), computed via an algorithm called the [Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform).  We will briefly describe how to do such calculations, without going into the underlying numerical details.\n",
    "\n",
    "To convert between a Fourier transform and a DFT, we first sample the values of $f(x)$ at $N$ *equally-spaced* points $[x_0, x_1, \\dots, x_{N-1}]$ (note that the index starts from 0), where $\\Delta x = x_{j+1} - x_j$.  These gives an array of $N$ numbers, $[f_0, f_1, \\dots, f_{N-1}]$, where $f_j = f(x_j)$. By definition, the DFT consists of $N$ numbers $[F_0, F_1, \\dots, F_{N-1}]$ such that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F_n = \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} \\exp\\left(-2\\pi i \\frac{nj}{N}\\right)\\, f_j.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The DFT can be computed by calling [`scipy.fft.fft`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.fftpack.fft.html) with the $[f_0,\\dots,f_{N-1}]$ array as the input. After that, there are three more things we need to do, in order to convert the $[F_0, \\dots, F_{N-1}]$ array into the values of the Fourier transform function $F(k)$:\n",
    "* We need the corresponding values of $k$. These can be obtained by calling [`scipy.fft.fftfreq`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.fftpack.fftfreq.html) with two inputs, $N$ and $\\Delta x$, and multiplying the result by $2\\pi$. This yields an array of $N$ numbers containing the values of $k$.\n",
    "* Next, we must re-arrange the arrays, since the $k$ values are not in monotonic order: the positive $k$'s are in the first half of the array, and the negative $k$'s are in the second half! (This is an artifact of the conventional definition of the DFT, which we will not go into.) To fix this, we call [`scipy.fft.fftshift`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.fftpack.fftshift.html), which takes an array and returns another array arranged in the appropriate (increasing-$k$) order. This must done for both the $F$ array and the $k$ array.\n",
    "* Finally, we multiply the $F$ array by a scale factor $\\Delta x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting array will contain the values of the Fourier transform $F(k)$, at the specified values of $k$, *up to a constant phase factor* of the form $\\exp(i\\theta)$, where $\\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}$.  However, we normally only care about $|F(k)|^2$; in that case, the phase factor is irrelevant and we don't need to work it out.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below show how to calculate numerical Fourier transforms, according to the above steps, for the function discussed in the previously example.  The Fourier transform of this function was previously calculated to be $F(k) = -i/(k+i\\eta)$."

    "### Fourier transforms for time-domain functions<a name=\"fourier_time\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have been dealing with functions of a spatial coordinate $x$.  Of course, these mathematical relations don't care about what kind of variable we are dealing with, so the Fourier transform concept can also be applied to functions of time $t$. However, there is a vexatious difference in convention that needs to be observed: when dealing with functions of the time coordinate $t$, it is customary to use a different sign convention in the Fourier relations!\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fourier relations for a function of time, $f(t)$, are:\n",
    "\n",
    ">$$\\left\\{\\;\\,\\begin{align}F(\\omega) &= \\;\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty dt\\; e^{i\\omega t}\\, f(t) \\\\ f(t) &= \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi}\\; e^{-i\\omega t}\\, F(\\omega).\\end{align}\\;\\,\\right\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "These relations differ in one notable way from the [previously-derived Fourier relations](#fourier_rels) between $f(x)$ and $F(k)$: the signs of the $\\pm i \\omega t$ exponents are flipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a good reason for this difference in sign convention: it arises from the need to describe propagating waves, which vary with both space *and* time.  As we have previously discussed, a propagating plane wave can be described by a [wavefunction](05_complex_waves.ipynb):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x,t) = A e^{i(kx - \\omega t)},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $k$ is the wave-number and $\\omega$ is the frequency.  We write the plane wave function this way so that positive $k$ indicates forward propagation in space (i.e., in the $+x$ direction), and positive $\\omega$ indicates forward propagation in time (i.e., in the $+t$ direction).  This requires the $kx$ and $\\omega t$ terms in the exponent to have opposite signs, so that when $t$ increases by a certain amount, a corresponding *increase* in $x$ leaves the total exponent unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, as we have seen, the inverse Fourier transform relation describes how a wave-form is broken up into a superposition of elementary waves.  In the case of a wavefunction $f(x,t)$, the superposition is given in terms of plane waves:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x,t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac{dk}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi}\\;\\; e^{i(kx-\\omega t)}\\, F(k,\\omega).$$\n",

This force has an arbitrary time dependence, and is not necessarily harmonic.  The equation of motion is\n",

    "where $X(\\omega)$ and $F(\\omega)$ are the Fourier transforms of $x(t)$ and $f(t)$ respectively. To obtain the left-hand side of this equation, we made use of the [properties of the Fourier transform described in the previous section](#basic_props), specifically linearity (1) and Fourier transformations of derivatives (4).  Note also that we have used the sign convention for time-domain functions [discussed earlier](#fourier_time).\n",

    "To summarize, the solution procedure for the driven harmonic oscillator equation consists of (i) using the Fourier transform on $f(t)$ to obtain $F(\\omega)$, (ii) using the above equation to find $X(\\omega)$ algebraically, and (iii) performing an inverse Fourier transform to obtain $x(t)$.  This is the basis for the [Green's function method](10_greens_function.ipynb), a method for systematically solving differential equations that will be discussed later."
