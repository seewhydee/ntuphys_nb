\section{Quantum states of multi-particle systems}

So far, we have studied quantum mechanical systems consisting of
single particles; the next important step is to consider systems of
multiple particles.  As we shall see, applying the postulates of
quantum mechanics to multi-particle systems leads to many important
and counterintuitive phenomena, such as \textbf{quantum entanglement}.

\subsection{Tensor products}
\label{sec:tensorprod}

Suppose we have two quantum objects, $A$ and $B$.  According to
quantum mechanics, $A$ is associated with some Hilbert space
$\mathscr{H}_A$ (i.e., every state of A is a vector in that space),
and $B$ is similarly associated with a Hilbert space $\mathscr{H}_B$.
The two spaces $\mathscr{H}_A$ and $\mathscr{H}_B$ may be
mathematically distinct; for example, they may have different
dimensions.  Obviously, the combined system of $A$ and $B$ should also
be describable by quantum mechanics.  What is its Hilbert space?

In linear algebra, there is an concept called the \textbf{tensor
  product} that happens to be exactly what we need.  Given $|a\rangle
\in \mathscr{H}_A$ and $|b\rangle \in \mathscr{H}_B$, consider an
ordered pair of these two vectors, which we call ``the tensor product
of $|a\rangle$ and $|b\rangle$''.  We denote this by
\begin{equation*}
  |a\rangle \otimes |b\rangle.
\end{equation*}
Note that this is an \textit{ordered} pair, i.e.,
$|a\rangle\otimes|b\rangle$ and $|b\rangle\otimes|a\rangle$ are not
identical.

It turns out that tensor products can act as vectors: we can form
linear combinations by adding them to each other and/or multiplying
them by scalars (complex numbers).  These vector operations are
compatible with the original vector operations for $\mathscr{H}_A$ and
$\mathscr{H}_B$, in the sense that they obey the ``factorization
rules''
\begin{align}
  \Big(\lambda |a\rangle
  + \lambda' |a'\rangle\Big) \otimes |b\rangle &=
  \lambda |a\rangle \otimes |b\rangle \,+\,
  \lambda' |a'\rangle \otimes |b\rangle, \label{tensorrule1} \\
  |a\rangle \otimes \Big(\lambda |b\rangle
  + \lambda' |b'\rangle\Big) &=
  \lambda |a\rangle \otimes |b\rangle \,+\,
  \lambda' |a\rangle \otimes |b'\rangle.
  \label{tensorrule2} 
\end{align}
(Note that the expressions inside the parentheses are vector
operations in $\mathscr{H}_A$ and $\mathscr{H}_B$ respectively.)
These are reminiscent of the rules of algebra, with $\otimes$ acting
like multiplication, except that $|a\rangle\otimes|b\rangle$ is not
considered equivalent to $|b\rangle\otimes|a\rangle$.

We will be dealing with tensor products a lot, and it can be
cumbersome to keep writing the $\otimes$.  For convenience, it is
customary to omit the $\otimes$ in bra-ket notation:
\begin{equation}
  |a \rangle \otimes |b\rangle \;\; \equiv \;\; |a \rangle |b\rangle.
\end{equation}
But even as we write the tensor product this way, as a ``product of
two kets'', the ordering remains important.  The left slot is
implicitly understood to contain the $A$-type ket, while the right
slot contains the $B$-type ket.

The space of all tensor products, \textit{and linear combinations
  thereof}, forms a Hilbert space.  We call this the \textbf{tensor
  product space} of $\mathscr{H}_A$ and $\mathscr{H}_B$, which is
denoted by
\begin{equation*}
  \mathscr{H}_A\otimes \mathscr{H}_B.
\end{equation*}
(For denoting tensor product spaces, we will not omit the $\otimes$
symbol.)  The tensor product thus provides a natural way to combine
two Hilbert spaces into a larger Hilbert space.

As an example, let $A$ and $B$ be distinct spin-$1/2$ degrees of
freedom, so that $\mathscr{H}_A = \mathscr{H}_B = \mathbb{C}^2$ (the
space of two-component complex vectors).  For each spin-$1/2$
subsystem, we can adopt the orthonormal basis
\begin{equation}
  |\!\uparrow\rangle = \begin{pmatrix}1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad
  |\!\downarrow\rangle = \begin{pmatrix}0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix},
\end{equation}
representing (e.g.)~a spin-up and spin-down state respectively.  From
these, we can construct four ordered pairs, $|\!\uparrow\rangle
|\!\uparrow\rangle$, $|\!\uparrow\rangle |\!\downarrow\rangle$,
$|\!\downarrow\rangle |\!\uparrow\rangle$, and $|\!\downarrow\rangle
|\!\downarrow\rangle$, each of which can be interpreted as a state of
the combined system of $A$ and $B$; for instance, $|\!\uparrow\rangle
|\!\downarrow\rangle$ represents a situation in which $A$ has spin up
and $B$ has spin down.  We assign to them the representation
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned}
  |\!\uparrow\rangle  |\!\uparrow\rangle
  &= \begin{pmatrix}1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0\end{pmatrix},\quad
  |\!\uparrow\rangle  |\!\downarrow\rangle
  = \begin{pmatrix}0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0\end{pmatrix}, \\
  |\!\downarrow\rangle  |\!\uparrow\rangle
  &= \begin{pmatrix}0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 0\end{pmatrix},\quad
  |\!\downarrow\rangle  |\!\downarrow\rangle
  = \begin{pmatrix}0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 1\end{pmatrix}.
  \end{aligned}
  \label{c4basis}
\end{align}
These constitute a basis for $\mathbb{C}^2 \otimes \mathbb{C}^2 =
\mathbb{C}^4$, which serves as the state space for the combined
system.  Given any two vectors for $A$ and $B$,
\begin{align}
  |a\rangle &=
  a_1 |\!\uparrow\rangle + a_2 |\!\downarrow\rangle =
  \begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \end{pmatrix} \in \mathbb{C}^2, \\
  |b\rangle &=
  b_1 |\!\uparrow\rangle + b_2 |\!\downarrow\rangle \,=
  \begin{pmatrix} b_1 \\ b_2 \end{pmatrix} \in \mathbb{C}^2,
\end{align}
the factorization rules \eqref{tensorrule1}--\eqref{tensorrule2} imply
that their tensor product is
\begin{equation}
  |a\rangle |b\rangle =
  a_1 b_1 |\!\uparrow\rangle |\!\uparrow\rangle
  + a_1 b_2 |\!\uparrow\rangle |\!\downarrow\rangle
  + a_2 b_1 |\!\downarrow\rangle |\!\uparrow\rangle
  + a_2 b_2 |\!\downarrow\rangle |\!\downarrow\rangle
  =
  \begin{pmatrix} a_1 b_1 \\ a_1 b_2 \\ a_2 b_1 \\ a_2 b_2 \end{pmatrix}.
  \label{tensordef}
\end{equation}
Conversely, we can take Eq.~\eqref{tensordef} as the definition of the
tensor product, which is consistent with the basis \eqref{c4basis},
and use it to derive the factorization rules
\eqref{tensorrule1}--\eqref{tensorrule2}.  For instance,
\begin{align}
  \left[\begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \end{pmatrix}
    + \begin{pmatrix} a_1' \\ a_2' \end{pmatrix} \right]
  \otimes \begin{pmatrix} b_1 \\ b_2 \end{pmatrix}
  &=
  \begin{pmatrix} (a_1+a_1') b_1 \\ (a_1+a_1') b_2 \\
    (a_2+a_2') b_1 \\ (a_2+a_2') b_2 \end{pmatrix} \\
  &=
  \begin{pmatrix} a_1 b_1 \\ a_1 b_2 \\ a_2 b_1 \\ a_2 b_2 \end{pmatrix}
  + \begin{pmatrix} a_1' b_1 \\ a_1' b_2 \\ a_2' b_1 \\ a_2' b_2 \end{pmatrix}\\
  &= \begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \end{pmatrix} \otimes
  \begin{pmatrix} b_1 \\ b_2 \end{pmatrix}
  + \begin{pmatrix} a_1' \\ a_2' \end{pmatrix} \otimes
  \begin{pmatrix} b_1 \\ b_2 \end{pmatrix}.
\end{align}

The dual (or ``bra'') of a tensor product $|a\rangle |b\rangle$ is
denoted by $\langle a| \langle b|$.  Note that taking the dual retains
the ordering of the tensor product: the bra for $A$ goes in the left
slot, and the bra for $B$ goes in the right slot.  From
Eq.~\eqref{tensordef}, the dual of a $\mathbb{C}^2\otimes\mathbb{C}^2$
tensor product ket is
\begin{equation}
  \langle a| \langle b| =
  \begin{pmatrix} a_1^* b_1^* & a_1^* b_2^*
    & a_2^* b_1^* & a_2^* b_2^* \end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}
Hence, the inner product between two tensor products is
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned}
  \Big(\langle a| \langle b|\Big)
  \Big(|a'\rangle |b'\rangle\Big)
  &= \begin{pmatrix} a_1^* b_1^* & a_1^* b_2^*
    & a_2^* b_1^* & a_2^* b_2^* \end{pmatrix}
  \begin{pmatrix} a_1' b_1' \\ a_1' b_2' \\
    a_2' b_1' \\ a_2' b_2' \end{pmatrix} \\
  &= (a_1^*a_1' + a_2^*a_2') (b_1^*b_1' + b_2^*b_2') \\
  &= \langle a|a'\rangle \; \langle b|b'\rangle.  
  \end{aligned}
  \label{inprodex}
\end{align}
The operation is performed ``slot by slot'', by taking the inner
products of the $A$-type and $B$-type vectors, and multiplying the
results together.  This is also consistent with the assumption that
the four basis states in \eqref{c4basis} form an orthonormal set.

The key features of the above example generalize to more complicated
tensor products.  Suppose the two subsystems $A$ and $B$ have
orthonormal bases denoted as follows:
\begin{align}
  \Big\{ |\alpha\rangle \Big\} &\;\;\textrm{is a basis for}\;\; \mathscr{H}_A,
  \;\mathrm{where}\;\; \alpha = 1, 2, \dots, \mathrm{dim}(\mathscr{H}_A)
  \label{subbasis1} \\
  \Big\{ |\beta\rangle \Big\} &\;\; \textrm{is a basis for}\;\; \mathscr{H}_B,
  \;\mathrm{where}\;\; \beta\, = 1, 2, \dots, \mathrm{dim}(\mathscr{H}_B).
  \label{subbasis2}
\end{align}
Note that the two bases may have different sizes (i.e.,
$\mathscr{H}_A$ and $\mathscr{H}_B$ may have different dimensions).
Following the same reasoning as in the preceding example, we can set
up a tensor product operation that obeys the factorization rules
\eqref{tensorrule1}--\eqref{tensorrule2}, and use
\eqref{subbasis1}--\eqref{subbasis2} to construct a basis for the
tensor product space:
\begin{align}
  \Big\{ |\alpha \rangle |\beta \rangle \Big\}
  \;\;\textrm{is a basis for}\;\; \mathscr{H}_A \otimes \mathscr{H}_B,
  \;\mathrm{where}\;
  \begin{cases}
    \;\;\alpha \!\!\!\!&= 1, 2, \dots, \mathrm{dim}(\mathscr{H}_A), \\
    \;\;\beta \!\!\!\!\!&= 1, 2, \dots, \mathrm{dim}(\mathscr{H}_B).
  \end{cases}
\end{align}
The basis states are orthonormal:
\begin{equation}
  \Big(\langle \alpha| \langle \beta|\Big)
  \Big(|\alpha'\rangle |\beta'\rangle\Big)
  = \langle \alpha|\alpha'\rangle \; \langle \beta|\beta'\rangle
  = \delta_{\alpha\alpha'} \delta_{\beta\beta'}.
  \label{innerprod}
\end{equation}
As a corollary, the dimension of the tensor product space is
\begin{equation}
  \dim\left[\mathscr{H}_A \otimes \mathscr{H}_B\right]
  = \mathrm{dim}(\mathscr{H}_A)\; \mathrm{dim}(\mathscr{H}_B).
  \label{tensordim}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Entanglement}

The above discussion of tensor product spaces contains an important
subtlety.  Even though we used tensor products of the form
\begin{equation}
  |a\rangle |b\rangle
  \label{tprod_generic}
\end{equation}
to help define the tensor product space, vectors drawn from
$\mathscr{H}_A \otimes \mathscr{H}_B$ do not necessarily have this
form.  This is because $\mathscr{H}_A \otimes \mathscr{H}_B$ contains
not only tensor products, but also all possible linear combinations of
tensor products.  The latter are \textit{not} guaranteed to have the
form \eqref{tprod_generic}.

In quantum mechanics, a tensor product like \eqref{tprod_generic} is
an obvious and natural way to describe a situation where subsystem $A$
is in state $|a\rangle$, and $B$ is in state $|b\rangle$.  For
instance, in our previous example of two spin-$1/2$ subsystems, if $A$
and $B$ are both in the spin-up state, the state of the combined
system is
\begin{equation}
  |\!\uparrow\rangle |\!\uparrow\rangle.
  \label{stateexample1}
\end{equation}
Similarly, suppose the states of $A$ and $B$ are
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned}
  |a\rangle &= |\!\uparrow\rangle,\\
  |b\rangle &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
  \Big(|\!\uparrow\rangle + |\!\downarrow\rangle\Big).
  \end{aligned}
\end{align}
Then the state of the combined system is
\begin{align}
  |a\rangle\, |b\rangle
  = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\, |\!\uparrow\rangle\,
  \Big(|\!\uparrow\rangle + |\!\downarrow\rangle\Big)
  \label{stateexample2}
\end{align}
But now consider the state
\begin{equation}
  |\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
  \Big(|\!\uparrow\rangle\, |\!\downarrow\rangle
  \,-\, |\!\downarrow\rangle \, |\!\uparrow\rangle\Big).
  \label{entangled_state}
\end{equation}
Just like \eqref{stateexample1} and \eqref{stateexample2}, this is a
valid vector in $\mathscr{H}_A \otimes \mathscr{H}_B =
\mathbb{C}^2\otimes\mathbb{C}^2$.  However, it turns out to be
impossible to re-write Eq.~\eqref{entangled_state} in the form
$|a\rangle|b\rangle$!  (We will prove this later, in
Section~\ref{sec:entropy}.)  In such a situation, $A$ and $B$ do not
individually have stand-alone quantum states; only the combined system
has a well-defined quantum state, $|\psi\rangle$.  We then say $A$ and
$B$ are \textbf{entangled}.  Entanglement leads to many
counterintuitive phenomena, which we will explore in the rest of this
chapter.

\subsection{Multiple subsystems}

The tensor product concept is easily extended to the case of more than
two subsystems.  Suppose a quantum system has $N$ subsystems with
Hilbert spaces $\mathscr{H}_1, \mathscr{H}_2, \dots, \mathscr{H}_N$.
Then the combined system is described by the Hilbert space
\begin{equation}
  \mathscr{H}_1 \otimes \mathscr{H}_2 \otimes \cdots \otimes
  \mathscr{H}_N,
\end{equation}
which has dimension
\begin{equation}
  \mathrm{dim}\left[\mathscr{H}_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathscr{H}_N\right]
  = \mathrm{dim}\left[\mathscr{H}_1\right] \cdot
  \mathrm{dim}\left[\mathscr{H}_2\right] \cdots
  \mathrm{dim}\left[\mathscr{H}_N\right].
\end{equation}
Note that the dimension scales exponentially with the number of
subsystems.  For instance, if there are 20 subsystems each having a 2D
Hilbert space, the combined Hilbert space has dimension $2^{20}
=1\,048\,576$.  This implies that quantum systems containing only a
modest number of particles can carry tremendous amounts of information
in their quantum states.  This is the primary motivation behind the
active research field of quantum computing.

%% By the way, the tensor product plays a role even in the quantum
%% mechanics of a particle moving in multiple spatial dimensions, even if
%% this was not emphasized in introductory courses.  For instance, in 2D
%% space the position is determined by two coordinates (e.g., $x$ and
%% $y$), so each position eigenstate is actually a tensor product:
%% \begin{equation*}
%%   |\,\mathbf{r} = (x,y)\,\rangle \;\equiv\; |x\rangle\otimes
%%   |y\rangle.
%% \end{equation*}

By the way, we assume for now that the subsystems in question are
distinguishable.  There are other complications arising if the
subsystems ``identical'' particles, which will be the subject of the
next chapter.  (If you're unsure what this paragraph is talking about,
never mind; just read on.)

\section{Partial measurements}
\label{sec:partialmeasurements}

Let us recall how measurements work in basic quantum theory.  Each
observable $Q$ is described by some Hermitian operator $\hat{Q}$,
which has an eigenbasis $\{|q\rangle\}$ such that
\begin{equation}
  \hat{Q}|q\rangle = q |q\rangle.
\end{equation}
For simplicity, let the eigenvalues $\{q\}$ be non-degenerate.
Suppose a system initially has quantum state $|\psi\rangle$.  This can
always be expanded in terms of the eigenbasis of $\hat{Q}$:
\begin{equation}
  |\psi\rangle = \sum_q |q\rangle \psi_q, \;\;\mathrm{where}\;\, \psi_q = \langle q|\psi\rangle.
  \label{psiexpansion}
\end{equation}
The measurement postulate of quantum mechanics states that if we
measure $Q$, then (i) the probability of obtaining each possible
outcome $q$ is
\begin{equation}
  P(q) = |\psi_q|^2,
  \label{Pq}
\end{equation}
and (ii) upon obtaining this outcome, the system instantly
collapses into state $|q\rangle$.

Mathematically, these two rules can be summarized using the projection
operator
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\Pi}(q) = |q\rangle\langle q|.
  \label{project}
\end{equation}
Applying this operator to $|\psi\rangle$ gives the non-normalized
state vector
\begin{equation}
  |\psi'\rangle = \hat{\Pi}(q) |\psi\rangle = |q\rangle \langle q|\psi\rangle.
\end{equation}
From this, we glean two pieces of information:
\begin{itemize}
\item The probability of obtaining this outcome is
  $P(q) = \langle\psi'|\psi'\rangle = |\langle q|\psi\rangle|^2$.

\item The post-measurement state is given by renormalizing
  $|\psi'\rangle$ to $|q\rangle$.
\end{itemize}

For combined systems (e.g., systems of multiple particles), there is a
new complication: \textit{what if a measurement is performed on just
  one subsystem}?

Suppose once again that we have two subsystems $A$ and $B$, with
combined Hillbert space $\mathscr{H}_A \otimes \mathscr{H}_B$.  We
perform a measurement on $A$, corresponding to a Hermitian operator
acting upon $\mathscr{H}_A$ whose eigenstates are
\begin{equation*}
  \big\{\;|\alpha\rangle\; \big\}, \quad
  \mathrm{where}~\alpha = 1, 2, \dots
\end{equation*}
To form a basis for $\mathscr{H}_A \otimes \mathscr{H}_B$, let us take
tensor products of these $A$ eigenstates with an arbitrary basis for
$B$, denoted by $\{|\beta\rangle\}$.  Any state $|\psi\rangle \in
\mathscr{H}_A \otimes \mathscr{H}_B$ can be expressed as
\begin{align}
  |\psi\rangle &= \sum_{\alpha\beta}
  \psi_{\alpha\beta}\, |\alpha\rangle |\beta\rangle \\
  &= \sum_\alpha |\alpha\rangle \underbrace{\left( \sum_\beta \psi_{\alpha\beta}\,|\beta\rangle\right)}_{\displaystyle \equiv |\varphi_\alpha\rangle}.
  \label{psi_twop}
\end{align}
Note that the vector $|\varphi_\alpha\rangle$ defined in
Eq.~\eqref{psi_twop} lies in $\mathscr{H}_B$; its $\alpha$ subscript
emphasizes that it depends on $\alpha$.

Let us compare Eq.~\eqref{psi_twop} with Eq.~\eqref{psiexpansion}.
Evidently, the $|\varphi_\alpha\rangle$ in \eqref{psi_twop} plays a
role similar to $\psi_q$ in \eqref{psiexpansion} (though the former is
a vector and the latter is a scalar).  Proceeding by analogy with
Eq.~\eqref{Pq}, the probability for each measurement outcome $\alpha$
should be
\begin{equation}
  P(\alpha) = \langle\varphi_\alpha|\varphi_\alpha\rangle
  = \sum_\beta |\psi_{\alpha\beta}|^2.
  \label{Palpha0}
\end{equation}

We can make the analogy clearer.  Previously, we saw how each
measurement outcome can be associated with a projection operator,
Eq.~\eqref{project}.  For a partial measurement, let us define the
\textbf{partial projector}
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\Pi}(\alpha) \,=\, |\alpha\rangle\langle \alpha| \otimes  \hat{I}.
\end{equation}
The $A$ slot contains the projection operator associated with the
measurement outcome $\alpha$, while the $B$ slot contains the identity
operator for $\mathscr{H}_B$ (as no measurement is done on $B$).
Applying this to Eq.~\eqref{psi_twop} gives
\begin{equation}
  |\psi'\rangle \,=\, \hat{\Pi}(\alpha)\, |\psi\rangle
  \,=\, |\alpha\rangle |\varphi_\alpha\rangle.
\end{equation}
Then, following the same rules as before, the probability of this
outcome is
\begin{equation}
  P(\alpha) = \langle\psi'|\psi'\rangle
  = \langle \alpha|\alpha\rangle\, \langle \varphi_\alpha|\varphi_\alpha\rangle
  = \sum_\beta |\psi_{\alpha\beta}|^2,
\end{equation}
in agreement with Eq.~\eqref{Palpha0}.  The post-measurement state is
obtained by re-normalizing $|\psi'\rangle$:
\begin{equation}
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{\langle\psi'|\psi'\rangle}} |\psi'\rangle
  =
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{\sum_{\beta'} |\psi_{\alpha\beta'}|^2}}\;
  \sum_{\beta} \psi_{\alpha\beta} |\alpha\rangle |\beta\rangle.
\end{equation}

\begin{framed}
\noindent
\textit{Example}---A system of two spin-$1/2$ particles is in
the ``singlet state''
\begin{equation}
  |\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \Big(|\!\uparrow\rangle|\!\downarrow\rangle \,-\, |\!\downarrow\rangle|\!\uparrow\rangle\Big).
\end{equation}
As usual, $|\!\uparrow\rangle$ and $|\!\downarrow\rangle$ are the
eigenstates of the spin operator $\hat{S}_z$, corresponding to the
eigenvalues $+\hbar/2$ and $-\hbar/2$ respectively.

If we measure $S_z$ on $A$, what is the probability of each outcome,
and the post-measurement state?

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{First outcome: $+\hbar/2$}.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The projected state is $\displaystyle |\psi'\rangle = \left(|\!\uparrow\rangle\langle\uparrow| \otimes \hat{I}\right)|\psi\rangle = 
    \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\,|\!\uparrow\rangle|\!\downarrow\rangle$.
  \item The outcome probability is $\displaystyle
    P(+) = \langle \psi'|\psi'\rangle = \frac{1}{2}$.
  \item The post-collapse state is $\displaystyle |\!\uparrow\rangle |\!\downarrow\rangle$
  \end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Second outcome: $-\hbar/2$}.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The projected state is $\displaystyle |\psi'\rangle = \left(|\!\downarrow\rangle\langle\downarrow| \otimes \hat{I}\right)|\psi\rangle = 
    -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\,|\!\downarrow\rangle|\!\uparrow\rangle$.
  \item The outcome probability is $\displaystyle P(-) = \langle \psi'|\psi'\rangle =
    \frac{1}{2}$.
  \item The post-collapse state is $\displaystyle |\!\downarrow\rangle |\!\uparrow\rangle$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
In other words, the two possible outcomes are equally probable, and
either way the state collapses so that $A$ and $B$ have opposite
spins.  After the measurement, note that $A$ and $B$ are no longer
entangled.
\end{framed}

\section{The Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen ``paradox''}

In 1935, Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (EPR) formulated a thought
experiment, now called the \textbf{EPR paradox}, highlighting the
counter-intuitive features of quantum entanglement [\ref{cite:epr}].
They intended for this to show that quantum theory cannot be a
fundamental description of reality.  Subsequently, it was shown that
the EPR paradox is not an actual paradox---physical systems
\textit{really do} behave like the thought experiment!  Nowadays, the
EPR ``paradox'' is regarded not as an argument against quantum
mechanics, but as an important tool for thinking about quantum
entanglement.

Consider, once again, the singlet state of two spin-$1/2$ particles,
$A$ and $B$ (which occupy the left and right slots of the tensor
product, respectively):
\begin{equation}
  |\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \Big(|\!\uparrow\rangle|\!\downarrow\rangle \,-\, |\!\downarrow\rangle|\!\uparrow\rangle\Big).
  \label{eprsinglet}
\end{equation}
As we saw in the previous section, measuring $S_z$ on $A$ leads to two
equally probable outcomes.  If the result is $+\hbar/2$, the
post-measurement state is $|\!\uparrow\rangle |\!\downarrow\rangle$,
and if the result is $-\hbar/2$, the post-measurement state is
$|\!\downarrow\rangle|\!\uparrow\rangle$.

The postulates of quantum theory indicate that the state collapse is
instantaneous.  So we can imagine preparing the two-particle state in
a laboratory on Earth, and transporting particle $A$ to Alice in the
Alpha Centauri star system, and particle $B$ to Bob in the Betelgeuse
system, many light years away:

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{epr}
\end{figure}

\noindent
In principle, this can be done carefully enough to avoid disturbing
the two-particle state.

Once ready, Alice measures $\hat{S}_z$ on $A$, inducing an
instantaneous collapse of the two-particle state.  Immediately
afterwards, Bob measures $\hat{S}_z$ on $B$, and obtains---with 100\%
probability---the result opposite to whatever Alice got.

During the time interval between these two measurements, no classical
signal could have traveled between the two star systems, not even at
the speed of light.  Yet the state collapse induced by Alice's
measurement affects the result of Bob's measurement!

One noteworthy aspect of this thought experiment is that it dispels
some commonsensical but mistaken explanations for state collapse.  For
instance, it is sometimes claimed that if we want to measure a
particle's position, we need to shine a light beam on it, or disturb
it in some way, and this disturbance generates an uncertainty in the
particle's momentum.  The EPR paradox shows that such stories don't
capture the weirdness of state collapse: quantum mechanics allows us
to collapse a particle's state without interacting directly with it,
but by performing a measurement on another particle far away.

Something else worth noting is that our experimentalists can exert a
degree of control over the state collapse, by their choice of what
measurements to perform.  For instance, if Alice measures $S_x$
(rather than $S_z$), the two-particle state collapses to something
like:
\begin{align*}
  |\!\rightarrow\rangle \otimes |\cdots\rangle &\qquad(\textrm{if Alice got $+\hbar/2$}) \\
  |\!\leftarrow\rangle \otimes |\cdots\rangle &\qquad(\textrm{if Alice got $-\hbar/2$}),
\end{align*}
which are different from the previous post-measurement states.  Could
this allow Bob to determine Alice's choice of measurement axis?  If
so, this would be a way to instantaenously transmit messages from
Alice to Bob, violating the theory of relativity!

Upon closer inspection, it turns out that controlling measurement axis
does \textit{not} allow Alice and Bob to communicate.  The key point
is that quantum states themselves cannot be measured; only observables
are measured.  By calculating the various measurement probabilities
from the singlet state \eqref{eprsinglet}, we can prove the following
(see \hyperref[ex:singletproperties]{Exercise 1}):

\begin{itemize}
\item
  If Alice measures along axis $n$, and Bob measures along $n'$, both
  of them have equal probabilities to obtain either outcome
  ($+\hbar/2$ or $-\hbar/2$), regardless of the axis choice.

\item If $n = n'$, Alice and Bob always get opposite results (similar
  to the $S_z$ case).
\end{itemize}

Since Bob always has equal probability to get either measurement
outcome, he cannot extract any information from Alice's collapse of
the two-particle state.  This implies that the thought experiment is
consistent \textit{in practice} with the theory of relativity.
Nonetheless, EPR argued that the instantaneous state collapse violates
the \textit{spirit} of relativity.

EPR suggested an alternative: maybe quantum mechanics is an
approximation of some deeper theory, whose details are currently
unknown, but which is deterministic and local.  Such a
\textbf{hidden-variable theory} may give the appearance of quantum
state collapse in the following way:

Suppose, contrary to quantum theory, that each particle has a definite
value of $S_z$, i.e., $S_z = +\hbar/2$ or $-\hbar/2$.  For simplicity,
let us denote these options as $+$ or $-$.  Let us hypothesize that
the two-particle quantum state $|\psi\rangle$ is not an actual
description of reality, but instead corresponds to a
\textit{statistical} distribution of ``hidden-variable states'',
denoted by $\hvbox[+]{-}$ (i.e., $S_z = +\hbar/2$ for $A$ and $S_z =
-\hbar/2$ for $B$), or $\hvbox[-]{+}$ (vice versa).

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{hiddenvariables}
\end{figure}

When Alice measures $S_z$, the hidden variable is revealed.  If she
got $+$, that means the original hidden-variable state must have been
$\hvbox[+]{-}$, whereas if she got $-z$, the hidden-variable state
must have been $\hvbox[-]{+}$.  When Bob subsequently measures $S_z$,
his result will be the opposite of Alice's, but these outcomes are
predetermined; there is no physical influence traveling between Alice
and Bob.

Clearly, there are many theoretical details missing: the
hidden-variable theory also needs to replicate all the successful
predictions made by quantum theory.  Trying to come up with a suitable
theory of this sort seems difficult, but with enough hard work, might
it be doable?

Well, no.

\section{Bell's theorem}
\label{sec:bell}

In 1964, Bell published a bombshell paper showing that the predictions
of quantum theory are inherently inconsistent with hidden-variable
theories [\ref{cite:bell}].  The amazing thing about this proof, which
is called \textbf{Bell's theorem}, is that it requires no knowledge
about the details of the hidden-variable theory, merely the fact that
it is deterministic and local.  Here, we present a simplified version
of Bell's theorem due to Mermin [\ref{cite:mermin}].

Yet again, we consider pairs of spin-1/2 particles, with particle $A$
sent to Alice and particle $B$ to Bob, with the two-particle state
\begin{equation}
  |\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \Big(|\!\uparrow\rangle|\!\downarrow\rangle \,-\, |\!\downarrow\rangle|\!\uparrow\rangle\Big).
  \label{bellsinglet}
\end{equation}
In each round of the thought experiment, Alice and Bob are each
allowed to measure their particle's spin along one of three possible
spin axes, whose observables are denoted by $S_1$, $S_2$, $S_3$ (we'll
specify the directions of these spin axes later).  Each
experimentalist chooses $S_1$, $S_2$, or $S_3$, \textit{randomly and
  with equal probabilities}.

Many rounds of the experiment are conducted.  Afterwards, we bring
together Alice's and Bob's experimental records, and examine their
axis choices and results.  For example:

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{bell}
\end{figure}

\noindent
If the results are consistent with quantum theory, whenever Alice and
Bob chose the same axis (by random chance), they must have obtained
opposite results.  For example, in the above records, they both chose
axis $S_3$ during Round 4; Alice got $-$, and Bob got $+$.

Can a hidden-variable theory reproduce such behavior?  In a
hidden-variable theory, each particle has a definite value for each
spin observable.  For example, $A$ might have $S_1 = +\hbar/2, \, S_2
= +\hbar/2, \, S_3 = -\hbar/2$, which we can denote more concisely as
`$++-$'.  For every spin axis, the two particles' hidden variables
must have opposite values.  Hence, there are $8$ possible
hidden-variable states, which we can denote like this:
\begin{align*}
  \begin{aligned}
    \hvbox[+++]{---} \;\;\;
    \hvbox[++-]{--+} \;\;\;
    \hvbox[+-+]{-+-} \;\;\;
    \hvbox[+--]{-++}\\
    \hvbox[-++]{+--} \;\;\;
    \hvbox[-+-]{+-+} \;\;\;
    \hvbox[--+]{++-} \;\;\;
    \hvbox[---]{+++}
  \end{aligned}
\end{align*}
For instance, $\hvbox[++-]{--+}$ indicates that $A$ has $S_1 = S_2 =
+\hbar/2$ and $S_3 = -\hbar/2$, while $B$ has $S_1 = S_2 = -\hbar/2$
and $S_3 = +\hbar/2$.  The hidden-variable theory postulates that the
two-particle state \eqref{bellsinglet} is actually some kind of
statistical distribution involving 8 hidden-variable states:
\begin{equation*}
  \Big\{ P\big(\hvbox[+++]{---}\,\big), \;P\big(\hvbox[++-]{--+}\,\big),
  \dots, P\big(\hvbox[---]{+++}\,\big) \Big\}.
\end{equation*}

Let us focus on the rounds in which Alice and Bob \textit{chose
  different spin axes}.  Within this subset, what is the probability
\textit{for their measurement results to have opposite signs}?  To
answer this question, we first consider these 6 hidden-variable
states:
\begin{align*}
  \begin{aligned}
    \hvbox[++-]{--+} \;\;\;
    \hvbox[+-+]{-+-} \;\;\;
    \hvbox[+--]{-++}\\
    \hvbox[-++]{+--} \;\;\;
    \hvbox[-+-]{+-+} \;\;\;
    \hvbox[--+]{++-}
  \end{aligned}
\end{align*}
These are the cases for which each particle's spin variables are not
all $+$ or all $-$.  Take the first case, $\hvbox[++-]{--+}$.  Under
our assumption that Alice and Bob chose different measurement axes,
there are two choices that give opposite signs for the measurement
results: $(S_1,S_2)$ or $(S_2,S_1)$.  Conversely, there are four
choices that give the same sign: $(S_1,S_3)$, $(S_2,S_3)$, $(S_3,S_1)$
and $(S_3, S_2)$.  Since the axis choices are totally random, the
probability of obtaining opposite signs for this hidden-variable state
is 1/3.  Going through the rest of the 6 hidden-variable states listed
above, we find that the probability to get opposite signs is likewise
1/3.  In the notation of conditional probabilities,
\begin{equation}
  P\big(\textrm{opp.} | \hvbox[++-]{--+}\,\big) =
  P\big(\textrm{opp.} | \hvbox[+-+]{-+-}\,\big) = \cdots = \frac{1}{3},
  \label{bell1}
\end{equation}
where ``opp.''~stands for opposite signs being obtained in the two
measurement results.

Now look at the remaining 2 hidden-variable states:
\begin{equation*}
    \hvbox[+++]{---} \;\;\;
    \hvbox[---]{+++}
\end{equation*}
For these, the conditional probabilities are
\begin{equation}
  P\big(\textrm{opp.} | \hvbox[+++]{---}\,\big) =
  P\big(\textrm{opp.} | \hvbox[---]{+++}\,\big) = 1.
  \label{bell2}
\end{equation}
By the law of conditional probabilities, the probability for the
``opposite signs'' outcome is
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned}
    P\big(\textrm{opp.}\big) &= \;\;\;
    P\big(\textrm{opp.} | \hvbox[++-]{--+}\,\big)
    P\big(\hvbox[++-]{--+}\,\big) \\
    &\quad+ P\big(\textrm{opp.} | \hvbox[+-+]{-+-}\,\big)
    P\big(\hvbox[+-+]{-+-}\,\big) \\
    &\quad+ \quad \cdots \\
    &\quad+ P\big(\textrm{opp.} | \hvbox[---]{+++}\,\big)
    P\big(\hvbox[---]{+++}\,\big),
  \end{aligned}
\end{align}
where the sum runs over all 8 possibilities (hidden-variable states).
We can use Eqs.~\eqref{bell1} and \eqref{bell2} to insert the
conditional probabilities, resulting in
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned}
    P\big(\textrm{opp.}\big) &=
    \frac{1}{3} \Big[\underbrace{P\big(\hvbox[++-]{--+}\,\big)
      + P\big(\hvbox[+-+]{-+-}\,\big)
      + \cdots + P\big(\hvbox[--+]{++-}\,\big)}_{\textrm{6 hidden-variable states
obeying Eq.~\eqref{bell1}}}\Big] \\
    &\quad + \underbrace{P\big(\hvbox[+++]{---}\,\big)
    + P\big(\hvbox[---]{+++}\,\big)}_{\textrm{2 hidden-variable states obeying \eqref{bell2}}}.
  \end{aligned}
\end{align}
It follows that
\begin{equation}
  P\big(\textrm{opp.}\big) \ge
  \frac{1}{3} \Big[\underbrace{P\big(\hvbox[++-]{--+}\,\big)
      + \cdots + P\big(\hvbox[---]{+++}\,\big)}_{\textrm{all 8 hidden-variable states}}
    \Big].
  \label{bellprob}
\end{equation}
The probabilities in the square brackets must sum to one.  Therefore,
\begin{equation}
  P\big(\textrm{opp.}\big) \ge \frac{1}{3}.
  \label{bellresult}
\end{equation}
This result, called \textbf{Bell's inequality}, can be summarized as
follows:

\begin{framed}
\noindent
\textit{In a hidden-variable theory, for the rounds where Alice and
  Bob choose different spin axes, their measurement results have
  opposite signs with probability $\ge 1/3$.}
\end{framed}

If we can find a situation where quantum theory predicts a violation
of Bell's inequality, that would prove quantum theory is inconsistent
with a broad class of hidden-variable theories.  It would not matter
how complicated the inner workings of the hidden-variable theory are,
so long as it meets the modest assumptions presented above (e.g.,
there are local deterministic hidden variables for each measurement,
the hidden-variable states are associated with probabilities summing
to one, etc.)

Thus, we seek a set of spin operators $\{S_1, S_2, S_3\}$ such that
quantum theory violates Bell's inequality.  One way to accomplish this
is to align $S_1$ with the $z$ axis, and place $S_2$ and $S_3$ in the
$x$-$z$ plane at $120^\circ$ ($2\pi/3$ radians) from $S_1$, as shown
below:

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{bellaxes}
\end{figure}

\noindent
Using simple geometry, we can write $\{S_1, S_2, S_3\}$ in terms of
the Pauli matrices $\hat{\sigma}_1$ and $\hat{\sigma}_3$:
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned}\hat{S}_1 &= \frac{\hbar}{2} \, \hat{\sigma}_3
    \\ \hat{S}_2 &= \frac{\hbar}{2} \, \left[\cos(2\pi/3) \hat{\sigma}_3 + \sin(2\pi/3)\hat{\sigma}_1\right]  \\   \hat{S}_3 &= \frac{\hbar}{2} \, \left[\cos(2\pi/3) \hat{\sigma}_3 - \sin(2\pi/3)\hat{\sigma}_1\right].\end{aligned}
\end{align}

For this choice of spin axes, suppose Alice chooses $S_1$ (i.e.,
$S_z$), and measures the result $+\hbar/2$.  Then the two-particle
state collapses to $|\!\uparrow\rangle |\!\downarrow\rangle$.  Bob is
assumed to choose a different spin axis.  If he chooses to measure
$S_2$, the expectation value for his measurement is
\begin{align}
  \langle\,\downarrow | \hat{S}_2 \,|\!\downarrow\,\rangle
  &= \frac{\hbar}{2} \,
  \Big[\cos(2\pi/3) \, \langle\,\downarrow|\sigma_3| \downarrow\,\rangle
    + \sin(2\pi/3)\, \langle\,\downarrow|\sigma_1|\downarrow\,\rangle\Big]\\
  &= \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2}.
  \label{bellP}
\end{align}
We can also write this expectation value in terms of the probabilities
for Bob to measure $+\hbar/2$ and $-\hbar/2$, denoted by $P_B(+)$ and
$P_B(-)$ respectively:
\begin{align}
  \langle\,\downarrow | \hat{S}_2 \,|\!\downarrow\,\rangle
  &= \left[+\frac{\hbar}{2} P_B(+) - \frac{\hbar}{2} P_B(-)\right] \\
  &= \frac{\hbar}{2} \Big[P_B(+) - P_B(-)\Big].
  \label{bellP2}
\end{align}
Eqs.~\eqref{bellP} and Eq.~\eqref{bellP2} together imply that
\begin{equation}
  P_B(+) - P_B(-) = \frac{1}{2}.
\end{equation}
Moreover, by probability conservation,
\begin{equation}
  P_B(+) + P_B(-) = 1.
\end{equation}
Hence, the probability for Bob to obtain a negative value (the
opposite of Alice's result) is
\begin{equation}
  P_B(-) = \frac{1}{4}.
  \label{Bobresult}
\end{equation}
In a similar fashion, we can work through all the other possible
scenarios involving different choices of spin axes by Alice and Bob.
All yield the same result as Eq.~\eqref{Bobresult}: i.e., assuming
Alice and Bob chose different measurement axis, the probability for
them to obtain opposite results is $1/4$.  Bell's inequality is
violated!

Last of all, we must consult Nature.  Is it possible to experimentally
observe a violation of Bell's inequality?  In the decades following
Bell's paper, many experiments were performed to answer this question.
These experiments are all substantially more complicated than the
above toy model, and are subject to various real-world imperfections.
But in the end, the experimental consensus is a clear \textit{yes}:
Nature agrees with quantum mechanics, not the hidden-variable
theories!  The experimental evidence is reviewed in a paper by Aspect
[\ref{cite:aspect}].

\section{Quantum cryptography}

One of the most remarkable consequences of Bell's thought experiment
is that it provides a way to perform cryptography that is more secure,
in certain respects, than conventional cryptography.  The possibility
of \textbf{quantum cryptography} is poised to be one of the most
important technological applications of quantum mechanics.  Here, we
describe one of the earliest quantum cryptography schemes, devised by
Ekert in 1991 [\ref{cite:ekert}].

Ekert's scheme allows two participants, Alice and Bob, to share with
each other a string of random binary digits (0 or 1), called a
``key''.  The objective is to make this sharing secure, in the sense
that no one else can eavesdrop and learn the key.  After Alice and Bob
have established the key, they can use it alongside various
non-quantum methods to encrypt messages between each other (e.g., by using the key as a
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad}{one-time pad}).

The scheme closely follows the Bell thought experiment from Section
\ref{sec:bell}.  Alice and Bob take part in multiple rounds of
measurements; during each round, a pair of spin-$1/2$ particles is
prepared in the singlet state \eqref{bellsinglet}, with particle $A$
going to Alice and $B$ going to Bob.  Each participant randomly
chooses an axis ($S_1$, $S_2$, or $S_3$), performs the corresponding
spin measurement, and secretly records down the result.

Alice and Bob then tell each other what axes they chose during the
measurement rounds.  These announcements are assumed to take place
over a communication channel that isn't necessarily secure, in the
sense that it might be eavesdropped upon; however, it is assumed that
the communications cannot be jammed or altered by any third party.
From this information, Alice and Bob identify the rounds in which they
picked the same axis (about 1/3 of the rounds), during which they must
have obtained exactly opposite measurement results.  These measurement
results are thus a string of random binary digits known to both Alice
and Bob, and no one else.

How might a third party, Eve, attempt to eavesdrop?  Suppose Eve was
able to intercept some or all of the $B$ particles intended for Bob.
She can try to extract some information from them (which, according to
quantum theory, means doing measurements on them), and then sending
some replacement particles to Bob (hoping he does not notice).
However, such measurements would break the entanglement between the
particles received by Alice and Bob.  The situation turns into a kind
of hidden-variable theory, where the hidden variables represent the
information extracted by Eve.

To check for Eve's tampering, Alice and Bob can publicly announce
their measurement results for the rounds in which their axes were
different.  (Remember, these rounds are not needed for the secret
key.)  Each of them can then check for a violation of Bell's
inequality, which would guarantee no eavesdropping has taken place.
For details, refer to Ref.~[\ref{cite:ekert}].

Alternatively, Eve might duplicate or ``clone'' the quantum state of
$B$ before it goes to Bob.  Then she can wait for Bob to announce his
choice of measurement axis for that round, perform that measurement on
her cloned particle, and reproduce Bob's result.  Though plausible at
first glance, this turns out to be incompatible with the laws of
quantum mechanics.

The so-called \textbf{no-cloning theorem} can be proven as follows.
Eve desires to clone an arbitrary state of a spin-half particle $B$
onto another spin-half particle $C$.  The two-particle Hilbert space
is $\mathscr{H}\otimes\mathscr{H}$.  With particle $C$ initially
prepared in some state $|0\rangle$, Eve must devise a unitary
operation $\hat{U}$, representing the cloning process, such that
\begin{equation}
  \hat{U} |\psi\rangle | 0\rangle = e^{i\phi} |\psi\rangle |\psi\rangle
  \label{clone}
\end{equation}
for all $|\psi\rangle \in \mathscr{H}$.  The phase factor $\phi$ can
depend on $|\psi\rangle$.

Now replace $|\psi\rangle$ in the above equation with two arbitrary
states denoted by $|\psi_1\rangle$ and $|\psi_2\rangle$, and take
their inner product.  According to Eq.~\eqref{clone},
\begin{align}
  \Big(\langle \psi_1 | \langle 0 | \hat{U}^\dagger \Big)
  \Big(\hat{U} | \psi_2 \rangle |0\rangle \Big)
  &=  \Big(\langle \psi_1| \langle \psi_1| e^{-i\phi_1} \Big) \Big( e^{i\phi_2} |\psi_2\rangle|\psi_2\rangle\Big) \\
  &= e^{-i(\phi_1-\phi_2)} \Big( \langle\psi_1 | \psi_2\rangle \Big)^2. \label{clone1}
\end{align}
Here, $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ are the phase factors from
Eq.~\eqref{clone} for the two chosen states.  On the other hand, since
$\hat{U}$ is unitary,
\begin{align}
  \langle \psi_1 | \langle 0 | \hat{U}^\dagger \hat{U} | \psi_2 \rangle |0\rangle
  &= \Big(\langle \psi_1 | \langle 0| \Big) \Big(| \psi_2 \rangle |0\rangle\Big)
  \\ &= \langle\psi_1 | \psi_2\rangle. \label{clone2}
\end{align}
Comparing the magnitudes of \eqref{clone1} and \eqref{clone2},
\begin{equation}
  \big|\langle \psi_1 | \psi_2\rangle \big|^2
  = \big| \langle\psi_1 | \psi_2\rangle \big|
  \;\;\Rightarrow \;\;
  \big|\langle\psi_1 | \psi_2\rangle\big| = 0 \;\mathrm{or}\; 1.
\end{equation}
But aside from the trivial case of a one-dimensional Hilbert space,
this cannot be true for arbitrary $|\psi_1\rangle$ and
$|\psi_2\rangle$.  For instance, for a two-dimensional space spanned
by an orthonormal basis $\{|0\rangle, |1\rangle\}$, we can pick
\begin{equation}
  |\psi_1\rangle = |0\rangle, \;
  |\psi_2\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\big(|0\rangle +
  |1\rangle\big)
  \;\;\Rightarrow\;\;
  \big|\langle\psi_1|\psi_2\rangle\big| = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}.
\end{equation}

\section{Density operators}

We now introduce \textbf{density operators}, which help streamline
calculations involving systems of multiple particles (or, more
generally, multiple subsystems).

Consider a quantum system with a $d$-dimensional Hilbert space
$\mathscr{H}$.  Given an arbitrary state $|\psi\rangle \in
\mathscr{H}$, define the Hermitian operator
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\rho} = |\psi\rangle\, \langle\psi|.
  \label{rho_pure}
\end{equation}
This is just the projection operator for $|\psi\rangle$, but in this
context we call it a ``density operator''.  Some other authors call it
a \textbf{density matrix}, based on the fact that linear operators can
be represented as matrices.

Using the density operator, we can re-express what we know about
measurements in quantum mechanics, as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $\hat{Q}$ be an observable with eigenvalues $\{q\}$ and
  eigenstates $\{|q\rangle\}$.  If we perform this measurement on
  $|\psi\rangle$, the probability of obtaining $q$ is
  \begin{equation}
    P(q) = \big|\langle q | \psi\rangle\big|^2 =
    \langle \mu |\, \hat{\rho}\, | \mu \rangle.
    \label{Pi_rho}
  \end{equation}

\item Moreover, the expectation value of the observable is
  \begin{equation}
    \langle Q\rangle
    = \sum_q q P(q)
    = \sum_q q \langle q | \hat{\rho}| q \rangle
    = \mathrm{Tr}\big[\,\hat{Q} \, \hat{\rho}\,\big].
    \label{Qexpt}
  \end{equation}
  In the last equality, $\mathrm{Tr}[\cdots]$ denotes the trace, which
  is the sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix representation of
  the operator.  The result is basis-independent.
\end{enumerate}

Now consider, once again, a composite system consisting of two
subsystems $A$ and $B$, with Hilbert spaces $\mathscr{H}_A$ and
$\mathscr{H}_B$.  Let's say we are interested in the properties of
$A$, meaning the probabilities and expectation values for any
measurements performed on $A$.  From the state of the combined system,
$|\psi\rangle \in \mathscr{H}_A\otimes \mathscr{H}_B$, we can
certainly calculate these quantities.  However, $|\psi\rangle$ also
contains a lot of information about $B$ that is irrelevant to us.

There is a more economical way to encode just the information about
$A$.  We can define the density operator for $A$ (sometimes called the
\textbf{reduced density operator}) as
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\rho}_A = \mathrm{Tr}_B \,\big[\,\hat{\rho}\,\big].
  \label{rhoa_def}
\end{equation}
Here, $\mathrm{Tr}_B[\cdots]$ refers to a \textbf{partial trace}.
This means tracing over the $\mathscr{H}_B$ part of the Hilbert space
$\mathscr{H}_A \otimes \mathscr{H}_B$, which yields an operator acting
on $\mathscr{H}_A$.

To better understand Eq.~\eqref{rhoa_def}, let us take an explicit
basis.  Let $\hat{Q}_A$ be an observable for $\mathscr{H}_A$ with
eigenbasis $\{|\alpha\rangle\}$, and let $\hat{Q}_B$ be an observable
for $\mathscr{H}_B$ with eigenbasis $\{|\beta\rangle\}$.  Starting
from the density operator of the combined system, $\hat{\rho} =
|\psi\rangle\langle \psi|$, the partial trace is
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\rho}_A =
    \sum_\beta
    \Big( \hat{I}\otimes \langle \beta| \Big)
    \; |\psi\rangle \langle \psi | \;
    \Big( \hat{I}\otimes | \beta\rangle \Big).
    \label{rhoa_explicit}
\end{equation}
This is a Hermitian operator for $\mathscr{H}_A$.  In the
$\{|\alpha\rangle\}$ basis, its diagonal matrix elements are
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned}
    \langle \alpha | \hat{\rho}_A | \alpha \rangle
    &=
    \sum_\beta
    \Big( \langle \alpha| \langle \beta| \Big)
    \, |\psi\rangle \langle \psi | \,
    \Big( |\alpha\rangle | \beta\rangle \Big) \\
    &=
    \langle \psi | \,
    \left[ |\alpha\rangle \langle \alpha| \otimes
      \left(\sum_\beta | \beta\rangle \langle \beta|\right) \right]
    |\psi\rangle \\
    &=
    \langle \psi | \,
    \Big( |\alpha\rangle \langle \alpha| \otimes \hat{I}_B\Big) |\psi\rangle.
  \end{aligned}
\end{align}
According to the rules of partial measurements discussed in
Section~\ref{sec:partialmeasurements}, this is precisely the
probability of obtaining $\alpha$ when measuring $\hat{Q}_A$ on
subsystem $A$:
\begin{equation}
  P(\alpha) = \langle \alpha | \hat{\rho}_A | \alpha \rangle.
  \label{rho_prob}
\end{equation}
It follows that the expectation value for the observable is
\begin{equation}
  \langle Q_A \rangle = \sum_\alpha \alpha
  \langle \alpha | \hat{\rho}_A | \alpha \rangle
  = \mathrm{Tr}\Big[\hat{Q}_A \, \hat{\rho}_A \Big].
  \label{rho_expect}
\end{equation}
These results hold for any choice of basis.  Hence, knowing
$\hat{\rho}_A$, we can calculate the probabilities for any measurement
performed on $A$.

To better understand these results, let us expand the state of the
combined system as
\begin{equation}
  |\psi\rangle = \sum_{\alpha\beta} \psi_{\alpha\beta} |\alpha\rangle |\beta\rangle,
\end{equation}
where $\sum_{\alpha\beta} |\psi_{\alpha\beta}|^2 = 1$.  Then
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\rho} = \sum_{\alpha\alpha'\beta\beta'} \psi_{\alpha\beta}
  \psi_{\alpha'\beta'}^* \; |\alpha\rangle |\beta\rangle \,
  \langle\alpha'|\langle \beta'|,
\end{equation}
and the reduced density operator is
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned}
    \hat{\rho}_A &= \sum_{\alpha\alpha'\beta} \psi_{\alpha\beta}\psi_{\alpha'\beta}^* |\alpha\rangle
    \langle\alpha'| \\
    &= \sum_\beta \left(\sum_\alpha \psi_{\alpha\beta} |\alpha\rangle\right)
    \left(\sum_{\alpha'} \psi_{\alpha'\beta}^*\langle\alpha'|\right) \\
    &= \sum_\beta |\varphi_\beta\rangle \langle \varphi_\beta|,
    \;\;\;\mathrm{where}\;\;\;
    |\varphi_\beta\rangle = \sum_\alpha \psi_{\alpha\beta} |\alpha\rangle.
  \end{aligned}
  \label{rhoa_tmp}
\end{align}
But $|\varphi_\beta\rangle$ is not necessarily normalized to unity:
\begin{equation}
  \langle \varphi_\beta | \varphi_\beta\rangle =
  \sum_{\alpha}|\psi_{\alpha\beta}|^2 \le 1.
\end{equation}
Let us therefore define the re-normalized states
\begin{equation}
  |\Psi_\beta\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{P_\beta}} |\varphi_\beta\rangle,
  \;\;\;\mathrm{where} \;\; P_\beta = \sum_{\alpha}|\psi_{\alpha\beta}|^2.
\end{equation}
Note that each $P_\beta$ is a non-negative real number in the range
$[0,1]$.  Eq.~\eqref{rhoa_tmp} now becomes
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\rho}_A = \sum_\beta P_\beta\, |\Psi_\beta\rangle
  \langle \Psi_\beta|,
  \;\;\;\mathrm{where}\;\;
  \begin{cases}
    \;\;\textrm{each $P_\beta$ is a real number in $[0,1]$, and} \\
    \;\;\textrm{each}\; |\Psi_\beta\rangle \in \mathscr{H}_A,
    \;\;\mathrm{with}
    \;\;\langle\Psi_\beta|\Psi_\beta\rangle = 1.
  \end{cases}
  \label{rhoform}
\end{equation}
We can interpret this as a weighted sum of individual density
operators, defined with a set of quantum states
$\{|\Psi_\beta\rangle\}$ and classical probabilities $\{P_\beta\}$.
This called an \textbf{ensemble} of states.  Note that the states in
the ensemble need not be orthogonal to each other.

Although we derived Eq.~\eqref{rhoform} from $|\psi\rangle$, the state
of the combined system, we cannot work backwards from $\hat{\rho}_A$
to figure out $|\psi\rangle$ (specifically, the coefficients
$\psi_{\alpha\beta}$).  In other words, $\hat{\rho}_A$ provides all
the necessary information regarding measurements on $A$, but does not
contain any extra information about subsystem $B$, or how $A$ and $B$
were entangled.  Therefore, we don't have to keep thinking of
$\hat{\rho}_A$ as a reduced density operator derived from some larger
state, but simply think of it as ``the density operator for $A$''.

From this point of view, a density operator of the form
$|\psi\rangle\langle\psi|$ is the special case of an ensemble of one
quantum state $|\psi\rangle$ with probability $P = 1$.  We call such
an ensemble a \textbf{pure state}.  If an ensemble is not a pure
state, implying that the system is entangled with something else, we
call it a \textbf{mixed state}.

In many circumstances, we can deduce that a system is in a given mixed
state without doing any partial trace to derive the density matrix.
For example, if the system with energy eigenbasis $\{|\psi_n\rangle\}$
and energies $\{E_n\}$ is in thermal equilibrium with an external heat
bath of temperature $T$, we can take the density operator to be
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\rho}_A = \sum_{n} \frac{\exp(-E_n/k_BT)}{Z} \, |E_n\rangle\langle E_n|,
\end{equation}
where $Z = \sum_n \exp(-E_n/k_BT)$.  This comes from the postulates of
statistical mechanics, rather than any actual derivation involving
tracing out the quantum degrees of freedom of the heat bath (which
would be a hopeless endeavor).

We can show that any linear operator $\hat{\rho}_A$ obeying
Eq.~\eqref{rhoform} has the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\hat{\rho}_A$ is Hermitian.

\item $\langle\varphi|\hat{\rho}_A|\varphi\rangle \ge 0$ for any
  $|\varphi\rangle \in \mathscr{H}_A$ (i.e., the operator is positive
  semidefinite).

\item For any observable $\hat{Q}_A$ acting on $\mathscr{H}_A$,
  \begin{align}
    \begin{aligned}
      \langle Q_A \rangle
      &\equiv \sum_\beta P_\beta
      \langle \Psi_\beta|\hat{Q}_A|\Psi_\beta\rangle \\
      &= \sum_{\alpha\beta} P_\beta\,
      \langle \Psi_\beta|\alpha\rangle \,
      \langle\alpha|\hat{Q}_A|\Psi_\beta\rangle
      \;\;\;\big(\textrm{using some basis} \;\{|\alpha\rangle\}\big) \\
      &= \sum_\alpha
      \langle\alpha|\hat{Q}_A \left(\sum_\beta |\Psi_\beta\rangle
      \langle \Psi_\beta|\right) |\alpha\rangle \\
      &= \mathrm{Tr}\left[\,\hat{Q}_A \,\hat{\rho}_A\,\right].
    \end{aligned}
    \label{prop3}
  \end{align}
  This also gives the probability for any measurement outcome: if
  $|\alpha\rangle$ is the eigenstate associated with the outcome, the
  outcome probability is $\langle\alpha|\hat\rho_A|\alpha\rangle$,
  consistent with Eq.~\eqref{rho_prob}.  To see this, take $\hat{Q}_A
  = |\alpha\rangle \langle \alpha|$ in Eq.~\eqref{prop3}.
  
\item The eigenvalues of $\hat{\rho}_A$, denoted by $\{p_1, p_2,
  \dots, p_{d_A}\}$, form a set of probabilities.  In other words,
  they satisfy
  \begin{equation}
    p_j \in \mathbb{R} \;\;\;\mathrm{and}\;\; 0 \le p_j \le 1 \;\;
    \mathrm{for}\;\; j = 1,\dots,d_A,
    \quad\mathrm{with}\;\; \sum_{j=1}^{d_A} p_j = 1.
    \label{trrho_reduced}    
  \end{equation}
  From this, it directly follows that
  \begin{equation}
    \mathrm{Tr}[\hat\rho_A] = 1.
  \end{equation}
  Property 4 follows from Property 3.  First, take $\hat{Q}_A =
  |j\rangle\langle j|$, where $|j\rangle$ is any eigenvector of
  $\hat\rho_A$ with eigenvalue $p_j$, and use Property 3 to prove that
  $0 \le p_j \le 1$.  Then take $\hat{Q} = \hat{I}_A$ and use Property
  3 to prove that the eigenvalues sum to 1.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Entanglement entropy}
\label{sec:entropy}

Previously, we said that a multi-particle system is entangled if the
individual particles lack definite quantum states.  It would be nice
to make this statement more precise, and in fact physicists have come
up with several different quantitive measures of entanglement.  In
this section, we will describe the most common measure,
\textbf{entanglement entropy}, which is closely related to the entropy
concept from thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, and information
theory.

We have seen from the previous section that if a subsystem $A$ is
(possibly) entangled with some other subsystem $B$, the information
required to calculate all partial measurement outcomes on $A$ is
stored within a reduced density operator $\hat{\rho}_A$.  We can use
this to define a quantity called the \textbf{entanglement entropy} of
$A$:
\begin{equation}
  S_{A} = - k_b \, \mathrm{Tr}_A \Big\{ \hat{\rho}_A\, \ln\!\big[\hat{\rho}_A\big]\Big\}.
  \label{entropy}
\end{equation}
In this formula, $\ln[\cdots]$ denotes the logarithm of an operator,
which is the inverse of the exponential: $\ln(\hat{P}) = \hat{Q}
\Rightarrow \exp(\hat{Q}) = \hat{P}$.  The prefactor $k_b$ is
Boltzmann's constant, and ensures that $S_A$ has the same units as
thermodynamic entropy.

The definition of the entanglement entropy is based on an analogy with
the entropy concept from classical thermodynamics, statistical
mechanics and information theory.  In those classical contexts,
entropy is a quantitative measure of uncertainty (i.e, lack of
information) about a system's underlying microscopic state, or
``microstate''.  Suppose a system has $W$ possible microstates that
occur with probabilities $\{p_1, p_2, \dots, p_W\}$, satisfying
$\sum_i p_i = 1$.  Then we define the classical entropy
\begin{equation}
  S_{\mathrm{cl.}} = - k_b \sum_{i=1}^W p_i \ln(p_i).
\end{equation}
In a situation of complete certainty where the system is known to be
in a specific microstate $k$ ($p_i = \delta_{ik}$), the formula gives
$S_{\mathrm{cl.}} = 0$.  (Note that $x \ln(x)\rightarrow 0$ as
$x\rightarrow 0$).  In a situation of complete uncertainty where all
microstates are equally probable ($p_i = 1/W$), we get
$S_{\mathrm{cl.}} = k_b \ln W$, the entropy of a microcanonical
ensemble in statistical mechanics.  For any other distribution of
probabilities, it can be shown that the entropy lies between these two
extremes: $0 \le S_{\mathrm{cl.}}  \le k_b\ln W$.  For a review of the
properties of entropy, see Appendix C.

The concept of entanglement entropy aims to quantify the uncertainty
arising from a quantum (sub)system's lack of a definite quantum state,
due to it being possibly entangled with another (sub)system.  When
formulating it, the key issue we need to be careful about is how to
extend classical notions of probability to quantum systems.  We have
seen that when performing a measurement on $A$ whose possible outcomes
are $\{q_\mu\}$, the probability of getting $q_\mu$ is $P_\mu =
\langle \mu | \hat{\rho}_A|\mu\rangle$.  However, it is problematic to
directly substitute these probabilities $\{P_\mu\}$ into the classical
entropy formula, since they are basis-dependent (i.e., the set of
probabilities is dependent on the choice of measurement).
Eq.~\eqref{entropy} bypasses this problem by using the trace, which is
basis-independent.

In the special case where $\{|\mu\rangle\}$ is the eigenbasis for
$\hat{\rho}_A$, the connection is easier to see.  From
\eqref{trrho_reduced}, the eigenvalues $\{p_\mu\}$ are all real numbers
between 0 and 1, and summing to unity, so they can be regarded as
probabilities.  Then the entanglement entropy is
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned}
    S_A &= -k_b \sum_\mu \langle \mu | \hat{\rho}_A \ln(\hat{\rho}_A) | \mu\rangle  \\
    &= - k_b \sum_\mu p_\mu \ln(p_\mu).
  \end{aligned}
\end{align}
Therefore, in this particular basis the expression for the
entanglement entropy is consistent with the classical definition of
entropy, with the eigenvalues of $\hat{\rho}_A$ serving as the
relevant probabilities.

By analogy with the classical entropy formula (see Appendix C), the
entanglement entropy has the following bounds:
\begin{equation}
  0 \le S_A \le k_b\ln(d_A),
  \label{Sabounds}
\end{equation}
where $d_A$ is the dimension of $\mathscr{H}_A$.

The lower bound $S_A = 0$ holds if and only if system $A$ is in a pure
state (i.e., it is not entangled with any other system).  This is
because the bound corresponds to a situation where $\hat{\rho}_A$ has
one eigenvalue that is 1, and all the other eigenvalues are 0 (see
Appendix C).  If we denote the eigenvector associated with the
non-vanishing eigenvalue by $|\psi\rangle$, then the density matrix
can be written as $\hat{\rho}_A = |\varphi\rangle\langle\varphi|$, which
has the form of a pure state.

As a corollary, if we find that $S_{A} \ne 0$, then $\hat{\rho}_A$
cannot be written as a pure state $|\psi\rangle\langle\psi|$ for
\textit{any} $|\psi\rangle$, and hence it must describe a mixed state.

A system is said to be \textbf{maximally entangled} if it saturates
the upper bound of \eqref{Sabounds}, $S_A = k_b \ln(d_A)$.  This
occurs if and only if the eigenvalues of the density operator are all
equal: i.e., $p_j = 1/d_A$ for all $j = 1, \dots, d_A$.

\begin{framed}
\noindent
\textit{Example}---Consider the singlet state of two spin-$1/2$
particles:
\begin{align}
  |\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \Big(|\!\uparrow\rangle|\!\downarrow\rangle \,-\, |\!\downarrow\rangle|\!\uparrow\rangle\Big).
\end{align}
The corresponding density operator is
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\rho}(\psi) = \frac{1}{2} \Big(|\!\uparrow\rangle|\!\downarrow\rangle \,-\, |\!\downarrow\rangle|\!\uparrow\rangle\Big) \Big(\langle\uparrow\!|\langle\downarrow\!| \,-\, \langle\downarrow\!|\langle\uparrow\!|\Big).
\end{equation}
Tracing over system $B$ (the second slot) yields the reduced density operator
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\rho}_A(\psi) = \frac{1}{2} \Big(|\!\uparrow\rangle \langle\uparrow\!| \,+\, |\!\downarrow\rangle \langle\downarrow\!|\Big).
\end{equation}
This can be expressed as a matrix in the
$\{|\!\uparrow\rangle,|\!\downarrow\rangle\}$ basis:
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\rho}_A(\psi) = \begin{pmatrix}\frac{1}{2} & 0 \\ 0 & \frac{1}{2}\end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}
Now we can use $\hat{\rho}_A$ to compute the entanglement entropy
\begin{equation}
  S_A = -k_b\mathrm{Tr}\left\{\hat{\rho}_A\ln(\rho_A)\right\} = -k_b\mathrm{Tr}\begin{pmatrix}\frac{1}{2}\ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) & 0 \\ 0 & \frac{1}{2}\ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\end{pmatrix} = k_b\ln(2).
\end{equation}
Hence, the particles are maximally entangled.
\end{framed}

\section{The Many Worlds Interpretation}

We conclude this chapter by discussing a set of compelling but
controversial ideas arising from the phenomenon of quantum
entanglement: the \textbf{Many Worlds Interpretation} as formulated by
Hugh Everett [\ref{cite:everett}].

So far, when describing the phenomenon of state collapse, we have
relied on the measurement postulate (see
Section~\ref{sec:partialmeasurements}), which is part of the
\textbf{Copenhagen Interpretation} of quantum mechanics.  This is how
quantum mechanics is typically taught, and how physicists think about
the theory when doing practical, everyday calculations.

However, the measurement postulate has two bad features:

\begin{enumerate}
\item It stands apart from the other postulates of quantum mechanics,
  for it is the only place where randomness (or ``indeterminism'')
  creeps into quantum theory.  The other postulates do not refer to
  probabilities.  In particular, the Schr\"odinger equation
\begin{equation}
  i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}|\psi(t)\rangle = \hat{H}(t) |\psi(t)\rangle
\end{equation}
is completely deterministic.  If you know $\hat{H}(t)$ and are given
the state $|\psi(t_0)\rangle$ at some time $t_0$, you can in principle
determine $|\psi(t)\rangle$ for all $t$.  This time-evolution consists
of a smooth, non-random rotation of the state vector within its
Hilbert space.  A measurement process, however, has a completely
different character: it causes the state vector to jump
discontinuously to a randomly-selected value.  It is strange that
quantum theory contains two completely different ways for a state to
change.

\item The measurement postulate is silent on what constitutes a
measurement.  Does measurement require a conscious observer?  Surely
not: as Einstein once exasperatedly asked, are we really expected to
believe that the Moon exists only when we look at it?  But if a given
device interacts with a particle, what determines whether it acts via
the Schr\"odinger equation, or performs a measurement?
\end{enumerate}

The Many Worlds Interpretation seeks to resolve these problems by
positing that \textit{the measurement postulate is \underline{not} a
  fundamental postulate of quantum mechanics}.  Rather, what we call
``measurement'', including state collapse and the apparent randomness
of measurement results, is an emergent phenomenon that can be derived
from the behavior of complex many-particle quantum systems obeying the
Schr\"odinger equation.  The key idea is that a measurement process
can be described by applying the Schr\"odinger equation to a quantum
system containing both the thing being measured \textit{and} the
measurement apparatus itself.

We can study this using a toy model formulated by Albrecht
[\ref{cite:albrecht}].  Consider a spin-$1/2$ particle, and an
apparatus designed to measure $S_z$.  Let $\mathscr{H}_S$ be the
spin-$1/2$ Hilbert space (which is 2D), and $\mathscr{H}_A$ be the
Hilbert space of the apparatus (which has dimension $d$).  We will
assume that $d$ is very large, as actual experimental apparatuses are
macroscopic objects containing $10^{23}$ or more atoms!  The Hilbert
space of the combined system is
\begin{equation}
  \mathscr{H} = \mathscr{H}_S \otimes \mathscr{H}_A,
\end{equation}
and is $2d$-dimensional.  Let us suppose the system is prepared in an initial
state
\begin{equation}
  |\psi(0)\rangle = \Big(a_+ |\!+z\rangle + a_- |\!-z\rangle\Big) \otimes |\Psi\rangle,
\end{equation}
where $a_\pm\in\mathbb{C}$ are the quantum amplitudes for the particle
to be initially spin-up or spin-down, and $|\Psi\rangle \in
\mathscr{H}_A$ is the initial state of the apparatus.

The combined system now evolves via the Schr\"odinger equation.  We
aim to show that if the Hamiltonian has the form
\begin{equation}
  \hat{H} = \hat{S}_z \otimes \hat{V},
\end{equation}
where $\hat{S}_z$ is the operator corresponding to the observable
$S_z$, then time evolution has an effect equivalent to the measurement
of $S_z$.

It turns out that we can show this without making any special choices
for $\hat{V}$ or $|\Psi\rangle$.  We only need $d \gg 2$, and for both
$\hat{V}$ and $|\Psi\rangle$ to be ``sufficiently complicated''.  We
choose $|\Psi\rangle$ to be a random state vector, and choose random
matrix components for the operator $\hat{V}$.  The precise generation
procedures will be elaborated on later.  Once we decide on
$|\Psi\rangle$ and $\hat{V}$, we can evolve the system by solving the
Sch\"odinger equation
\begin{equation}
  |\psi(t)\rangle = U(t)|\psi(0)\rangle, \;\;\;\mathrm{where}\;\; \hat{U}(t) = \exp\left[-\frac{i}{\hbar}\hat{H}t\right].
\end{equation}
Because the part of $\hat{H}$ acting on the $\mathscr{H}_S$ subspace
is $\hat{S}_z$, the result necessarily has the following form:
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned}|\psi(t)\rangle &= \hat{U}(t)\Big(a_+ |\!+\!z\rangle + a_- |\!-\!z\rangle\Big) \otimes |\Psi\rangle \\ &= a_+ |\!+\!z\rangle \otimes |\Psi_+(t)\rangle \;+\; a_- |\!-\!z\rangle \otimes |\Psi_-(t)\rangle. \end{aligned}
\end{align}
Here, $|\Psi_+(t)\rangle$ and $|\Psi_-(t)\rangle$ are apparatus states
that are ``paired up'' with the $|\!+\!z\rangle$ and $|\!-\!z\rangle$
states of the spin-$1/2$ subsystem.  At $t=0$, both
$|\Psi_+(t)\rangle$ and $|\Psi_-(t)\rangle$ are equal to
$|\Psi\rangle$; for $t > 0$, they rotate into different parts of the
state space $\mathscr{H}_A$.  If the dimensionality of $\mathscr{H}_A$
is sufficiently large, and both $\hat{V}$ and $|\Psi\rangle$ are
sufficiently complicated, we can guess (and we will verify numerically) that
the two state vectors rotate into completely different parts of
the state space, so that
\begin{equation}
  \langle\Psi_+(t) | \Psi_-(t)\rangle \approx 0 \;\;\;\textrm{for sufficiently large}\;\; t.
\end{equation}
Once this is the case, the two terms in the above expression for
$|\psi(t)\rangle$ can be interpreted as two decoupled ``worlds''.  In
one world, the spin has a definite value $+\hbar/2$, and the apparatus
is in a state $|\Psi_+\rangle$ (which might describe, for instance, a
macroscopically-sized physical pointer that is pointing to a ``$S_z =
+\hbar/2$'' reading).  In the other world, the spin has a definite
value $-\hbar/2$, and the apparatus has a different state
$|\Psi_-\rangle$ (which might describe a physical pointer pointing to
a ``$S_z = -\hbar/2$'' reading).  Importantly, the $|\Psi_+\rangle$
and $|\Psi_-\rangle$ states are orthogonal, so they can be rigorously
distinguished from each other.  The two worlds are
``weighted'' by $|a_+|^2$ and $|a_-|^2$, which correspond to the
probabilities of the two possible measurement results.

The above description can be tested numerically.  Let us use an
arbitrary basis for the apparatus space $\mathscr{H}_A$; in that
basis, let the $d$ components of the initial apparatus state vector
$|\Psi\rangle$ be random complex numbers:
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned}
  |\Psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mathcal{N}}}\, \begin{pmatrix}\Psi_0 \\ \Psi_1 \\ \vdots \\ \Psi_{d-1}
  \end{pmatrix}, \;\; \mathrm{where} \;\; \mathrm{Re}(\Psi_j), \mathrm{Im}(\Psi_j) \sim N(0,1).
  \end{aligned}
\end{align}
In other words, the real and imaginary parts of each complex number
$\Psi_j$ are independently drawn from the the standard normal
(Gaussian) distribution, denoted by $N(0,1)$.  The normalization
constant $\mathcal{N}$ is defined so that $\langle\Psi|\Psi\rangle =
1$.

Likewise, we generate the matrix elements of $\hat{V}$ according to
the following random scheme:
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned}A_{ij} &\sim u_{ij} + i v_{ij}, \;\;\;\mathrm{where}\;\;u_{ij},v_{ij}\sim N(0,1)\\ \hat{V} &= \frac{1}{2\sqrt{d}} \left(\hat{A} + \hat{A}^\dagger\right).\end{aligned}
\end{align}
This scheme produces a $d\times d$ matrix with random components,
subject to the requirement that the overall matrix be Hermitian.  The
factor of $1/2\sqrt{d}$ is relatively unimportant; it ensures that the
eigenvalues of $\hat{V}$ lie in the range $[-2,2]$, instead of scaling
with $d$ [\ref{cite:edelman}].

The Schr\"odinger equation can now be solved numerically.  The results
are shown below:

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{decoherence}
\end{figure}

In the inital state, we let $a_+ = 0.7$, so $a_- = \sqrt{1-0.7^2} =
0.71414\dots$ The upper panel plots the overlap between the two
apparatus states, $|\langle\Psi_+|\Psi_-\rangle|^2$, versus $t$.  In
accordance with the preceding discussion, the overlap is unity at $t =
0$, but subsequently decreases to nearly zero.  For comparison, the
lower panel plots the entanglement entropy between the two subsystems,
$S_A = -k_b \mathrm{Tr}_A\left\{\hat{\rho}_A\ln\hat{\rho}_A\right\}$,
where $\hat{\rho}_A$ is the reduced density matrix obtained by tracing
over the spin subspace.  We find that $S_A = 0$ at $t=0$, due to the
fact that the spin and apparatus subsystems start out with definite
quantum states in $|\psi(0)\rangle$.  As the system evolves, the
subsystems become increasingly entangled, and $S_A$ increases up to
\begin{equation}
  S_A^{\mathrm{max}}/k_b = - \Big( |a_+|^2 \ln|a_+|^2 + |a_-|^2\ln|a_-|^2 \Big) \approx 0.693
\end{equation}
This value is indicated in the figure by a horizontal dashed line, and
corresponds to the result of the classical entropy formula for
probabilities $\{|a_+|^2,|a_-|^2\}$.  Moreover, we see that the
entropy reaches $S_A^{\mathrm{max}}$ at around the same time that
$|\langle\Psi_+|\Psi_-\rangle|^2$ reaches zero.  This demonstrates the
close relationship between ``measurement'' and ``entanglement''.

For details about the numerical linear algebra methods used to perform
the above calculation, refer to Appendix D.

The ``many worlds'' concept can be generalized from the above toy
model to the universe as a whole.  In the viewpoint of the Many Worlds
Interpretation of quantum mechanics, the entire universe can be
described by a mind-bogglingly complicated quantum state, evolving
deterministically according to the Schr\"odinger equation.  This
evolution involves repeated ``branchings'' of the universal quantum
state, which continuously produces more and more worlds.  The
classical world that we appear to inhabit is just one of a vast
multitude.  It is up to you to decide whether this conception of
reality seems reasonable.  It is essentially a matter of preference,
because the Copenhangen Interpretation and the Many Worlds
Interpretation have identical physical consequences, which is why they
are referred to as different ``interpretations'' of quantum mechanics,
rather than different theories.




\section*{Exercises}

\begin{enumerate}

\item \label{ex:singletproperties}
Consider the singlet state
\begin{equation}
  |\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \Big(|\!\uparrow\rangle|\!\downarrow\rangle \,-\, |\!\downarrow\rangle|\!\uparrow\rangle\Big),
\end{equation}
where the left- and right-hand slots refer to subsystems $A$ and $B$
respectively, and $\{|\!\uparrow\rangle, |\!\downarrow\rangle\}$
denote the eigenstates of the spin operator $\hat{S}_z$ with
eigenvalue $\pm\hbar/2$.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Suppose we perform a measurement on $A$ using a rotated spin
  observable
\begin{equation}
  \hat{S}_n = \hat{U}^\dagger \hat{S}_z \hat{U},
\end{equation}
where $\hat{U}$ is a unitary rotation matrix.  The eigenstates of
$\hat{S}_n$ are $|\!\pm n\rangle = \hat{U}^\dagger |\!\updownarrow\rangle$, with
eigenvalues $\pm \hbar/2$.  For each measurement outcome $\pm\hbar/2$,
prove that the collapsed two-particle state is (up to arbitrary phase
and normalization factors)
\begin{equation}
  |\psi'\rangle \propto |\pm \!n \rangle\; |\mp\! n\rangle.
\end{equation}
Hint: you don't need the explicit form of $\hat{U}$, only the fact
that it is unitary.

\item Denote the probabilities of the two outcomes in part (a) by
  $P(A_+)$ and $P(A_-)$.  Derive expressions for these two
  probabilities.

\item For each of the two outcomes from measuring $S_n$ on $A$, find
  the measurement probabilities for a subsequent $S_z$ measurement on
  $B$, denoted by $P(B_+|A_\pm)$ and $P(B_-|A_\pm)$.  Hence, show that
  \begin{align}
    P(B_+) &= P(B_+|A_+) P(A_+) + P(B_+|A_-) P(A_-) = \frac{1}{2}\\
    P(B_-) &= P(B_-|A_+) P(A_+) + P(B_-|A_-) P(A_-) = \frac{1}{2},
  \end{align}
  regardless of $n$.  Optional: generalize this to any $B$ measurement
  axis.

  This can be regarded as a equal-probability ensemble of two pure
  states, $|\!\uparrow\rangle$ and $|\!\rightarrow\rangle$.  However,
  find the eigenvalues of $\hat{\rho}$, and show that they are
  \textit{not} equal to 1/2.

\item 
  Consider two distinguishable particles, $A$ and $B$.  The 2D Hilbert
  space of $A$ is spanned by $\{|m\rangle, |n\rangle\}$, and the
  3D Hilbert space of $B$ is spanned by $\{|p\rangle, |q\rangle,
  |r\rangle\}$.  The two-particle state is
\begin{equation}
  |\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{3} \, |m\rangle|p\rangle
+ \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \, |m\rangle|q\rangle
+ \frac{1}{\sqrt{18}} \, |m\rangle|r\rangle
+ \frac{\sqrt{2}}{3} \, |n\rangle|p\rangle
+ \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \, |n\rangle|q\rangle
+ \frac{1}{3} \, |n\rangle|r\rangle.
\end{equation}
Find the entanglement entropy.

%% For decades after the discovery of quantum mechanics, the quantum
%% double-slit experiment was just a ``thought experiment'', meant to
%% illustrate the features of quantum mechanics that had been uncovered
%% by other, more complicated experiments.  Nowadays, the most convenient
%% way to do the experiment is with light, using single-photon sources
%% and single-photon detectors.  Quantum interference has also been
%% demonstrated experimentally using electrons, neutrons, and even
%% large-scale particles such as buckyballs.
