\section{Scattering experiments on quantum particles}
\label{sec:scatintro}

Quantum particles exhibit a feature known as \textbf{wave-particle
  duality}, which can be summarized in the \textbf{quantum double-slit
  thought experiment}.  As illustrated below, a source emits electrons
of energy $E$ toward a screen with a pair of slits.  A movable
detector, placed on the far side, measures the arrival rates at
different positions.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.52\textwidth]{doubleslit}
\end{figure}

The experiment reveals the following: (i) the electrons arrive in
discrete units, like classical particles; (ii) the
\textit{statistical} distribution of electron arrivals forms an
interference pattern, like a diffracted wave.  In the non-relativistic
limit, the inferred wavelength $\lambda$ is related to the electron
energy $E$ by
\begin{equation}
  \lambda = \frac{2\pi}{k}, \;\;\; E = \frac{\hbar^2k^2}{2m},
\end{equation}
where $\hbar = h/2\pi$ is Dirac's constant, and $m$ is the electron
mass.  (Thus, if $E$ is known, we can deduce the spacing of the slits
from the diffraction pattern.)

%% Wave-particle duality arises from quantum theory's distinction between
%% a particle's state and the outcomes of measurements performed on it.
%% The state is described by a wavefunction $\psi(\mathbf{r})$, which can
%% undergo diffraction like a classical wave.  On the other hand, the
%% probability of measuring a particle in a volume $dV$ around position
%% $\mathbf{r}$ is given by $|\psi(\mathbf{r})|^2 \,dV$.

In this chapter, we will study a generalization of the double-slit
experiment called a \textbf{scattering experiment}.  The idea is to
shoot quantum particles at a target, called a \textbf{scatterer}, and
measure the distribution of scattered particles.  Just as the
double-slit interference pattern can be used to deduce the slit
spacing, a scattering experiment can be used to deduce various facts
about the scatterer.  Scattering experiments constitute a large
proportion of the methods used to probe the quantum world, from
electron- and photon-based microscopy to accelerator experiments in
high-energy physics.

We will focus on the non-relativistic scattering experiment depicted
below:

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.58\textwidth]{scattering}
\end{figure}

\noindent
An unbounded $d$-dimensional space is described
by coordinates $\mathbf{r}$, with a scatterer near $\mathbf{r} = 0$.
An incoming quantum particle, with energy $E$, is governed by the
Hamiltonian
\begin{equation}
  \hat{H} = \hat{H}_0 + V(\hat{\mathbf{r}}),
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
  \hat{H}_0 = \frac{\hat{\mathbf{p}}^2}{2m}
\end{equation}
describes the particle's kinetic energy, $m$ is the particle's mass,
$\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ and $\hat{\mathbf{p}}$ are the position and
momentum operators, and $V$ is a \textbf{scattering potential}
describing how the scatterer acts upon the particle.  We assume this
potential vanishes far from the scatterer:
\begin{equation}
  V(\mathbf{r}) \; \overset{|\mathbf{r}| \rightarrow \infty}{\longrightarrow}\; 0.
\end{equation}

How is the particle scattered by the potential?  In order to study
this, we formulate the above description as the following mathematical
problem:
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
A particle state $|\psi\rangle$ obeys the time-independent
Schr\"odinger equation
\begin{equation}
  \hat{H} |\psi\rangle = E |\psi\rangle,
\end{equation}
where $E$ is the incoming particle energy.

\item
The state $|\psi\rangle$ can be decomposed into two pieces,
\begin{equation}
  |\psi\rangle \,=\, |\psi_i\rangle \,+\, |\psi_s\rangle,
\end{equation}
where $|\psi_i\rangle$ is called the \textbf{incident state} and
$|\psi_s\rangle$ is called the \textbf{scattered state}.

\item
The incident state is described by a plane wave, which is a
simultaneous eigenstate of $\hat{H}_0$ (with energy $E$) and
$\hat{\mathbf{p}}$ (with momentum $\mathbf{p}_i$):
\begin{equation}
  \begin{cases}
  \hat{H}_0 |\psi_i\rangle &= \, E |\psi_i\rangle, \\
  \;\;\hat{\mathbf{p}} |\psi_i\rangle &= \, \mathbf{p}_i |\psi_i\rangle,
  \end{cases}
  \quad \mathrm{where} \;\;\; E = \frac{|\mathbf{p}_i|^2}{2m}.
\end{equation}

\item
The scattered state is an ``outgoing'' state.  What this means will be
explained later.
\end{enumerate}
We can interpet the above statements as follows.  Statement 1 says the
scattering is elastic: the scatterer is described by a potential
$V(\mathbf{r})$, so its interaction with the particle is conservative
and $E$ is fixed.  Statement 2 says that the wavefunction
$\psi(\mathbf{r}) = \langle \mathbf{r} |\psi\rangle$ is a
superposition of an incoming wave and a scattered wave.  Statement 3
defines the incoming wave as a plane wave with wavelength determined
by $E$.  Statement 4 says the scattered wave moves outward to
infinity, away from the scatterer.

Note that Statements 1--4 do \textit{not} define an eigenproblem!
Usually, we deal with the time-independent Schr\"odinger equation by
finding eigenvalues and eigenstates.  But here we are given
$|\psi_i\rangle$, $E$, and $V(\mathbf{r})$, and want $|\psi_s\rangle$.
In particular, $E$ is an input to the calculation (a continuously
variable parameter), not an output (an eigenvalue).

\section{Recap: position and momentum states}
\label{sec:waves}

Before proceeding, let us review the properties of a quantum particle
in free space.  In a $d$-dimensional space, a coordinate vector
$\mathbf{r}$ is a real vector with $d$ components.  We suppose there
is a uncountably infinite set of position eigenstates,
$\{|\mathbf{r}\rangle\}$, where each $|\mathbf{r}\rangle$ describes a
particle with a definite position $\mathbf{r}$.  The position
eigenstates are assumed to span the state space, such that the
identity operator can be resolved as
\begin{equation}
  \hat{I} = \int d^dr \, |\mathbf{r}\rangle \langle\mathbf{r}|,
  \label{Iresol}
\end{equation}
with the integral is taken over all allowed $\mathbf{r}$ (e.g.,
$\mathbf{r} \in \mathbb{R}^d$).  It follows that
\begin{equation}
  \langle \mathbf{r} | \mathbf{r}' \rangle = \delta^d(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}').
  \label{rrprime}
\end{equation}
Thus, we say that the position eigenstates are
\textbf{delta-normalized}, rather than being normalized to unity.
Here $\delta^d(\cdots)$ denotes the $d$-dimensional delta function;
e.g., in 2D,
\begin{equation*}
  \langle x,y \,|\, x',y' \rangle = \delta(x-x') \, \delta(y-y').
\end{equation*}
Moreover, the position operator $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ is defined such
that $\hat{\mathbf{r}} |\mathbf{r}\rangle \,=\, \mathbf{r}\,
|\mathbf{r}\rangle$.

Momentum eigenstates are constructed from position eigenstates via
Fourier transforms.  First, let us suppose $\mathbf{r}$ runs over a
finite box of length $L$ on each side, with periodic boundary
conditions.  For plane waves of the form
$\exp(i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r})$, where $\mathbf{k} = (k_1, \dots,
k_d)$ is the wave-vector, the periodic boundary conditions are
satisfied if and only if
\begin{equation}
  k_j = 2\pi m/L\;\;\mathrm{for} \;m\in\mathbb{Z}.
\end{equation}
Note that the set of allowed wave-vectors is discrete (i.e.,
countable), with a discretization of $\Delta k = 2\pi/L$ in each
direction.  Next, define
\begin{equation}
  |\mathbf{k}\rangle = \frac{1}{L^{d/2}} \, \int d^dr \; e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}} |\mathbf{r}\rangle,
  \label{pdef}
\end{equation}
where the integral is taken over the box.  We identify
$|\mathbf{k}\rangle$ as a momentum eigenstate, i.e., a state with
definite momentum $\hbar \mathbf{k}$.  Using
Eqs.~\eqref{Iresol}--\eqref{rrprime} and Eq.~\eqref{pdef}, we can show
that
\begin{equation}
  \langle\mathbf{k}|\mathbf{k}'\rangle = \delta_{\mathbf{k},\mathbf{k}'}, \quad \langle\mathbf{r}|\mathbf{k}\rangle = \frac{1}{L^{d/2}} e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}}, \quad I = \sum_{\mathbf{k}} |\mathbf{k}\rangle\,\langle\mathbf{k}|.
\end{equation}
In particular, note that each momentum eigenstate is normalizable to
unity.

Now let us take $L \rightarrow \infty$.  In this limit, the
wave-vector discretization $\Delta k = 2\pi / L$ goes to zero, so the
momentum eigenvalues coalesce into a continuum.  To handle this, we
redefine the momentum eigenstates as
\begin{equation}
  |\mathbf{k}\rangle^{(\textrm{new})} = \left(\frac{L}{2\pi}\right)^{d/2} |\mathbf{k}\rangle^{(\textrm{old})}.
\end{equation}
Then, by using the formula
\begin{equation}
  \int_{-\infty}^\infty dx\; \exp(ikx) \;=\; 2\pi\, \delta(k),
\end{equation}
we can show that the new momentum eigenstates are related to the
position eigenstates by
\begin{framed}
  \begin{align}
      |\mathbf{k}\rangle &= \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{d/2}} \, \int d^dr \; e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}} |\mathbf{r}\rangle, \label{kcontdef} \\
      |\mathbf{r}\rangle &= \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{d/2}} \, \int d^dk \; e^{-i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}} |\mathbf{k}\rangle. \label{rcontdef}
  \end{align}
\end{framed}
\vskip -0.1in
\noindent
Position and momentum are now treated on similar footing, with the
integrals over $\mathbf{r}$ and $\mathbf{k}$ both taken over infinite
spaces.  Moreover, the momentum eigenstates now satisfy
\begin{align}
  I &= \int d^dk \;|\mathbf{k}\rangle\,\langle\mathbf{k}|, \label{Iresolk} \\
  \langle\mathbf{k}|\mathbf{k}'\rangle &= \delta^d(\mathbf{k}-\mathbf{k}'),
  \label{kkprime} \\
  \langle\mathbf{r}|\mathbf{k}\rangle &= \frac{e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}}}{(2\pi)^{d/2}}. \label{kwavefun}
\end{align}
The first two equations are analogous to their position eigenstate
counterparts, Eq.~\eqref{Iresol} and \eqref{rrprime}.  In particular,
Eq.~\eqref{kkprime} says the new $|\mathbf{k}\rangle$'s are
delta-normalized.  The last equation, \eqref{kwavefun}, can be
interpreted as the wavefunction of the delta-normalized momentum
eigenstate.

The momentum operator $\hat{\mathbf{p}}$ is defined using the
$|\mathbf{k}\rangle$'s as the eigenbasis:
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\mathbf{p}} |\mathbf{k}\rangle \,=\, \hbar \mathbf{k}\, |\mathbf{k}\rangle.
  \label{pop}
\end{equation}
For any quantum state $|\psi\rangle$, whose wavefunction is
$\psi(\mathbf{r}) = \langle \mathbf{r}|\psi\rangle$, we can use
Eqs.~\eqref{rcontdef} and \eqref{pop} to show that the momentum
operator acts on wavefunctions in the following way:
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned}\langle \mathbf{r}|\hat{\mathbf{p}}|\psi\rangle
    &= \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{d/2}} \, \int d^dk \; e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}} \langle \mathbf{k} | \hat{\mathbf{p}} | \psi\rangle \\
    &= \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{d/2}} \, \int d^dk \; \hbar\mathbf{k} \, e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}} \langle \mathbf{k} | \psi\rangle \\
    &= -i \hbar\nabla \left[\frac{1}{(2\pi)^{d/2}} \, \int d^dk \, e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}} \langle \mathbf{k} | \psi\rangle \right] \\
    &= -i\hbar \nabla\psi(\mathbf{r}).
  \end{aligned}
\end{align}

\section{Scattering from a 1D delta function potential}
\label{sec:1dscatter}

We are now ready to solve a simple scattering problem.  Consider a 1D
space with spatial coordinate $x$, and a scattering potential
consisting of a ``spike'' at $x = 0$:
\begin{equation}
  V(x) = \frac{\hbar^2\gamma}{2m} \,\delta(x).
  \label{Vdeltaf}
\end{equation}
The form of the prefactor $\hbar^2\gamma/2m$ is chosen for later
convenience; the parameter $\gamma$, which has units of $[1/x]$,
controls the strength of the scattering potential.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{scattering1d}
\end{figure}

The particle wavefunction $\psi(x)$ satisfies the 1D Schr\"odinger
wave equation
\begin{equation}
  \left[-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{d^2}{dx^2} + V(x) \right] \psi(x)
  = E \psi(x).
  \label{1dschrod}
\end{equation}
As this is a second-order differential equation, we normally require
$\psi(x)$ to be continuous and to have well-defined first and second
derivatives.  However, the delta function potential \eqref{Vdeltaf}
relaxes these requirements in a peculiar way: at $x=0$, $\psi(x)$ must
still be continuous, but its first derivative may now be discontinuous
(and hence, its second derivative is singular).  To see this,
integrate Eq.~\eqref{1dschrod} over an infinitesimal range around $x =
0$:
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned}\lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow 0^+} \int_{-\varepsilon}^{+\varepsilon} dx\; \left[-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{d^2}{dx^2} + \frac{\hbar^2\gamma}{2m} \delta(x)\right] \psi(x) &= \lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow 0^+} \int_{-\varepsilon}^{+\varepsilon} dx\; E \psi(x) \\ = \lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow 0^+} \left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \left[\frac{d\psi}{dx}\right]_{-\varepsilon}^{+\varepsilon} \right) + \frac{\hbar^2\gamma}{2m} \psi(0) &= 0.
  \end{aligned}
\end{align}
Therefore,
\begin{equation}
  \lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow 0^+} \left(\; \left.\frac{d\psi}{dx}\right|_{x = +\varepsilon} - \;\; \left.\frac{d\psi}{dx}\right|_{x = -\varepsilon}\; \right) =  \gamma \,\psi(0).
  \label{delta_discontinuity}
\end{equation}

To proceed, suppose the particle is incident from the left, with
energy $E$.  As discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:scatintro}, the particle's
quantum state is the sum of an incident state $|\psi_i\rangle$ and a
scattered state $|\psi_s\rangle$, and $|\psi_i\rangle$ is
proportional to a momentum eigenstate $|k\rangle$, where $k =
\sqrt{2mE/\hbar^2} > 0$.  We said ``proportional'', not ``equal'', for
it is conventional to take
\begin{equation}
  |\psi_i\rangle = \sqrt{2\pi}\, \Psi_i |k\rangle \;\;\; \Leftrightarrow\;\;\; \psi_i(x) = \langle x|\psi\rangle = \Psi_i \, e^{ik x}.
  \label{psiin1d}
\end{equation}
The complex constant $\Psi_i$ is called the \textbf{incident
  amplitude}.  With this, Eq.~\eqref{1dschrod} becomes
\begin{equation}
  \left[-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{d^2}{dx^2} + \frac{\hbar^2\gamma}{2m}\delta(x)\right] \Big(\Psi_i \, e^{ikx} + \psi_s(x) \Big)
  = E \Big(\Psi_i \, e^{ikx} + \psi_s(x) \Big).
\end{equation}
Taking $E = \hbar^2k^2/2m$, and doing a bit of algebra, simplifies this to
\begin{equation}
  \left[ \frac{d^2}{dx^2} + k^2\right] \psi_s(x)
  = \gamma \delta(x) \Big(\Psi_i \, e^{ikx} + \psi_s(x) \Big).
  \label{deltaschrod}
\end{equation}

We can construct the solution by separately considering the regions $x
< 0$ and $x > 0$.  Within each half-space, $\delta(x)$ vanishes so
Eq.~\eqref{deltaschrod} reduces to the Helmholtz equation
\begin{equation}
  \left[\frac{d^2}{dx^2} + k^2\right] \psi_s(x) = 0.
\end{equation}
This has the general solution
\begin{equation}
  \psi_s(x) = \Psi_i \left(f_R \, e^{ik x} + f_L \, e^{-ik x}\right),
\end{equation}
which is a superposition of right-moving ($e^{ikx}$) and left-moving
($e^{-ikx}$) waves.  The complex parameters $f_1$ and $f_2$ can
have different values in the $x < 0$ and $x > 0$ regions.

We want the scattered wave to be an outgoing wave.  Thus, for $x < 0$,
$\psi_s$ is purely left-moving, so $f_R = 0$; and for $x > 0$,
$\psi_s$ is purely right-moving, so $f_L = 0$.  Therefore,
\begin{equation}
  \psi_s(x) = \Psi_i \times \begin{cases}f_- \,e^{-ikx}, & x < 0 \\ f_+ \,e^{ikx}, & x > 0.\end{cases}
\end{equation}
The complex numbers $f_-$ and $f_+$ are called \textbf{scattering
  amplitudes}.  They parameterize the magnitude and phase of the
scattered wavefunction moving outward from the scatterer.

Recall from the discussion at the beginning of this section that
$\psi(x)$ must be continuous at $x = 0$.  This implies that
$\psi_s(x)$ is also continuous, and therefore that
\begin{equation}
  f_- = f_+ \;\;\;\Rightarrow \;\;\;
  \psi_s(x) = \Psi_i \,f_\pm\, e^{ik|x|}.
  \label{psis1d}
\end{equation}
Plugging Eqs.~\eqref{psiin1d} and \eqref{psis1d} into
Eq.~\eqref{delta_discontinuity} yields
\begin{equation}
  f_\pm = -\frac{\gamma}{\gamma - 2ik}.
\end{equation}

For now, let us focus on the magnitude of the scattering amplitude (in
the next chapter, we will see that the phase also contains useful
information).  The quantity $|f_\pm|^2$ describes the overall strength
of the scattering process:
\begin{equation}
  |f_\pm|^2 = \left[1 + \frac{8mE}{(\hbar\gamma)^2}\right]^{-1}.
\end{equation}
Its dependence on $E$ is plotted below:

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.52\textwidth]{scattering1df}
\end{figure}

\noindent
The behavior matches our intuition.  For a given particle energy $E$,
the scattering grows stronger as the potential strength parameter
$|\gamma|$ increases.  On the other hand, for fixed $\gamma$, a
higher-energy particle undergoes less scattering.  Note also that
attractive potentials ($\gamma < 0$) and repulsive potentials ($\gamma
> 0$) are equally effective at scattering.

\section{Scattering amplitude and scattering cross section}
\label{sec:scattering_amplitude}

In the 1D scattering problem of the previous section, the particle can
only scatter in two directions: forward or backward.  In 2D and higher
spatial dimensions, there is an important complication: the particle
can also go ``sideways'', and in fact there is a continuous set of
directions for it to scatter into.  To deal with this, physicists have
introduced a systematic formalism for expressing the outcomes of a
scattering experiment.

In $d$ spatial dimensions, consider (as before) a planar incident
wavefunction
\begin{equation}
  \psi_i(\mathbf{r}) = \Psi_i \, e^{i\mathbf{k}_i\cdot\mathbf{r}},
  \label{psiin}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{k}$ is the incident wave-vector, whose magnitude is $k
= |\mathbf{k}|$.  Similar to the 1D case, \eqref{psiin1d}, we call the
complex coefficient $\Psi_i$ the \textbf{incident wave amplitude}.

The incident wavefunction generates a scattered wavefunction
$\psi_s(\mathbf{r})$.  We can express the $\mathbf{r}$-dependence of
this wavefunction using a coordinate system of the form $(r,\Omega)$,
where $r$ is the distance from the origin and $\Omega$ denotes the
other ``directional'' coordinates.  Specifically,
\begin{itemize}
\item For $d = 2$, we use polar coordinates $(r,\phi)$, i.e.~$\Omega
  \equiv \phi$.

\item For $d = 3$, we use spherical coordinates $(r, \theta, \phi)$,
  i.e.~$\Omega \equiv (\theta,\phi)$.
\end{itemize}
We can also wrangle the $d = 1$ case into this framework by letting
$\Omega \in \{+, -\}$, where $+$ denotes the forward ($+x$) direction
and $-$ denotes the backward ($-x$) direction.

We assert that, far from the origin, the scattered wavefunction must
reduce to the form
\begin{equation}
  \psi_s(\mathbf{r})\;  \overset{r\rightarrow\infty}{\longrightarrow}\; \Psi_i \, r^{\frac{1-d}{2}} \, e^{ikr} \, f(\Omega).
  \label{psiscat}
\end{equation}
To understand the reasoning behind this, let us go through the
individual multiplicative factors on the right side of
Eq.~\eqref{psiscat}.

First, the $\Psi_i$ factor registers the fact that the Schr\"odinger
wave equation is linear---if we multiply the incident wavefunction
\eqref{psiin} by any complex number, the resulting scattered
wavefunction must be multiplied by the same factor.

The next two factors, $r^{\frac{1-d}{2}} \, e^{ikr}$, give the
$r$-dependence of a wave expanding radially from the origin in $d$
dimensions.  The $e^{ikr}$ factor captures its outgoing nature (the
wavefunction's phase increases along the direction of propagation,
i.e., the direction of increasing $r$).  The other factor provides the
$r$-scaling needed for probability conservation.  Note that the
probability current density associated with the scattered wavefunction
is
\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{J}_s = \frac{\hbar}{m} \mathrm{Im}\big[\psi_s^*\nabla\psi_s\big].
\end{equation}
Thus, its radial component is
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}J_{s}^r\; &= \frac{\hbar}{m}\, \mathrm{Im}\left[\psi_s^* \frac{\partial}{\partial r}\psi_s\right] \\
    &\overset{r\rightarrow\infty}{\longrightarrow}\;\, \big(\cdots\big)
    \mathrm{Im}\left[\left(r^{\frac{1-d}{2}} \, e^{ikr}\right)^* \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left(r^{\frac{1-d}{2}} \, e^{ikr}\right)\right] \\
    &= \big(\cdots\big)\,
    \mathrm{Im}\left[\left(r^{\frac{1-d}{2}} \, e^{ikr}\right)^* \left(ik r^{\frac{1-d}{2}} \, e^{ikr} + \frac{1-d}{2} \, r^{\frac{-1-d}{2}} \, e^{ikr}\right)\right] \\
    &= \big(\cdots\big) \, r^{-(d-1)} + O(r^{-d}),
  \end{aligned}
  \label{Jsrcalc}
\end{equation}
where $(\cdots)$ denotes $r$-independent terms.  In $d$ dimensions,
the area of the surface at distance $r$ from the origin scales as
$r^{d-1}$.  Hence, $J_{s}^r$ scales inversely with area, and the total
flux obtained by integrating $J_{s}^r$ over the area is independent of
$r$.

The final factor in Eq.~\eqref{psiscat}, $f(\Omega)$, is called the
\textbf{scattering amplitude} and describes how the particle is
scattered in various directions.  This complex function's magnitude,
phase, and $\Omega$-dependence are the main avenues by which the
scattering experiment can reveal information about the scattering
potential---for, as noted in the previous paragraphs, the other
factors are fully determined by linearity, outgoing-ness, and
probability conservation.

Sometimes, we write the scattering ammplitude using the alternative
notation
\begin{equation}
  f(\mathbf{k}_i \rightarrow \mathbf{k}_f), \;\;\;\mathrm{where}\;\; \mathbf{k}_f = k \hat{\mathbf{r}}.
\end{equation}
This emphasizes firstly that the incident wave-vector is
$\mathbf{k}_i$; and secondly that the particle is scattered in some
direction which can be specified by either the unit position vector
$\hat{\mathbf{r}}$, or equivalently by the momentum vector
$\mathbf{k}_f = k \hat{\mathbf{r}}$, or by the angular coordinates
$\Omega$.

From the scattering amplitude, we can define two other important
quantities:
\begin{framed}
  \begin{align}
    \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} &= \big|f(\Omega)\big|^2 \qquad\quad\quad \text{(the \textbf{differential scattering cross section})} \\ \sigma &= \int d\Omega\; \big|f(\Omega)\big|^2 \quad\; \text{(the \textbf{total scattering cross section}).} \label{sigma}
  \end{align}
\end{framed}
\vskip -0.1in
\noindent
In Eq.~\eqref{sigma}, $\int d\Omega$ denotes the integral(s) over all
the angle coordinates.  For 1D, this is replaced by a discrete sum
over the forward and backward directions (see above).

The term ``cross section'' comes from an analogy with the scattering
of classical particles.  Imagine a stream of classical particles
incident on a ``hard-body'' scatterer:

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.44\textwidth]{crosssection}
\end{figure}

\noindent
Let the incident classical particles have the same flux as the
incident wavefunction \eqref{psiin},
\begin{equation}
  J_{i} = \frac{\hbar k}{m} \;|\Psi_i|^2.
  \label{incidentflux}
\end{equation}
Note that this has units of $[x^{1-d}t^{-1}]$ (i.e., number per unit
time per unit area in $d$ dimensions).  We assume the scatterer only
interacts with the particles striking it directly, and the rate at
which these strikes occur is
\begin{equation}
  I_s = J_i \, \sigma,
  \label{scattersigma}
\end{equation}
where $\sigma$ is the exposed cross-sectional area of the scatterer,
as shown in the figure.  This is the \textit{total} rate at which
scattering occurs, regardless of where the particles scatter to.

Let us compare this to the quantum mechanical scattering rate.  Using
Eq.~\eqref{psiscat}, we can repeat the calculation in \eqref{Jsrcalc}
for the radial component of the probability current density:
\begin{equation}
  J_s^r \; \overset{r\rightarrow\infty}{\longrightarrow}\;
  \frac{\hbar \,k}{m}\; |\Psi_i|^2 \; |f(\Omega)|^2 \,r^{1-d}
  + O(r^{-d}).
\end{equation}
Hence, the total flux of outgoing probability is
\begin{equation}
  I_s = \int d\Omega\; r^{d-1} \, J_{s,r}
  = \left(\frac{\hbar k}{m} \;|\Psi_i|^2\right) \; \int d\Omega\; \big|f(\Omega)\big|^2.
  \label{scatterI}
\end{equation}
On the right side, the quantity in parentheses is the incident flux,
Eq.~\eqref{incidentflux}.  Comparing Eq.~\eqref{scatterI} to
Eq.~\eqref{scattersigma}, we see that
\begin{equation*}
  \sigma \equiv \int d\Omega \; \big|f(\Omega)\big|^2
\end{equation*}
is the quantity analogous to the exposed cross-sectional area of the
classical hard-body.  We therefore call this the \textbf{total
  scattering cross section}.

Moreover, the integrand $|f|^2$ represents the rate, per unit of solid
angle, at which particles are scattered in a given direction.  We call
this the \textbf{differential scattering cross section}.  The total
and differential scattering cross sections are the principal
observable quantities typically obtained in scattering experiments.

\section{The Green's function}
\label{sec:greensfun}

The scattering amplitude $f(\Omega)$ can be calculated using a variety
of analytical and numerical methods.  We will discuss one particularly
important approach, based on a quantum variant of the Green's function
technique for solving inhomogenous differential equations.

Let us return to the previously-discussed formulation of the
scattering problem:
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned} \hat{H} &= \hat{H}_0+\hat{V} \\ \hat{H} |\psi\rangle &= E |\psi\rangle \\ |\psi\rangle &= |\psi_i\rangle \,+\, |\psi_s\rangle \\ \hat{H}_0 |\psi_i\rangle &= E |\psi_i\rangle.\end{aligned}
\end{align}
These equations can be combined as follows:
\begin{align}
  \left(\hat{H}_0 + \hat{V}\right) |\psi_i\rangle + \hat{H} |\psi_s\rangle &= E \left( |\psi_i\rangle + |\psi_s\rangle \right) \\
  \Rightarrow \quad \hat{V} |\psi_i\rangle + \hat{H} |\psi_s\rangle &= E |\psi_s\rangle  \\
  \Rightarrow \quad\; \left(E - \hat{H}\right) |\psi_s\rangle & = \hat{V} |\psi_i\rangle \label{EmHeq}
\end{align}
To proceed, we define an operator called the \textbf{Green's
  function}, which is the inverse of the operator on the left side of
Eq.~\eqref{EmHeq}:
\begin{equation}
  \hat{G}(E) = \big(E-\hat{H}\big)^{-1}.
  \label{Gdef}
\end{equation}
Note that $\hat{G}(E)$ depends parametrically on $E$.  This operator
is the key to solving the scattering problem, because
\begin{equation}
  |\psi_s\rangle = \hat{G} \hat{V} |\psi_i\rangle.
  \label{scatterform}
\end{equation}

We can also define the Green's function for a free particle,
\begin{equation}
  \hat{G}_0(E)=\big(E-\hat{H}_0\big)^{-1}.
  \label{G0unregulated}
\end{equation}
As we shall see, $\hat{G}_0$ is often useful because it can be
calculated exactly, whereas $\hat{G}$ typically has no closed-form
analytic expression.  We can relate $G$ and $G_0$ as follows:
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned}
    \hat{G}(E-\hat{H}_0 - \hat{V})\;\; &= I \;\;\;\mathrm{and}\;\; (E-\hat{H}_0 - \hat{V})\hat{G} = I \\ \Rightarrow \;\;\; \hat{G} \hat{G}_0^{-1} - \hat{G}\hat{V} &= I \;\;\; \mathrm{and}\;\;\;\;\, \hat{G}_0^{-1} \hat{G} - \hat{V}\hat{G} \;\;\;= I.
  \end{aligned}
\end{align}
Upon respectively right-multiplying and left-multiplying these equations
by $\hat{G}_0$, we arrive at the following pair of equations, called
\textbf{Dyson's equations}:
\begin{framed}
  \begin{align}
    \hat{G} \;&= \; \hat{G}_0 + \hat{G}\hat{V}\hat{G}_0 \\
    \hat{G} \;&=\; \hat{G}_0 + \hat{G}_0\hat{V}\hat{G} \label{dyson2}
  \end{align}
\end{framed}
\vskip-0.1in
\noindent
These equations are ``implicit'', as the unknown $\hat{G}$ appears on
both the left and right sides.

Applying the second Dyson equation, Eq.~\eqref{dyson2}, to the
scattering problem \eqref{scatterform} gives
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned}|\psi_s\rangle &= \left(\hat{G}_0 + \hat{G}_0\hat{V}\hat{G}\right) \hat{V} |\psi_i\rangle \\ &= \hat{G}_0 \hat{V} |\psi_i\rangle + \hat{G}_0\hat{V}\hat{G} \hat{V} |\psi_i\rangle \\ &= \hat{G}_0 \hat{V} |\psi_i\rangle + \hat{G}_0\hat{V} |\psi_s\rangle \\ &= \hat{G}_0\hat{V} |\psi\rangle.\end{aligned}
  \label{psis_implicity}
\end{align}
This equation is likewise implicit, as the right side contains the
unknown $|\psi\rangle$.  We can try to solve it by iteration, i.e.,
repeatedly plugging the equation into its own right side:
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned}|\psi_s\rangle &= \hat{G}_0 \hat{V} \left(|\psi_i\rangle + \hat{G}_0 \hat{V}|\psi\rangle\right) \\ &= \quad \vdots \\ &= \left[\hat{G}_0 \hat{V} + (\hat{G}_0 \hat{V})^2 + (\hat{G}_0 \hat{V})^3 + \cdots\right]|\psi_i\rangle.\end{aligned}
\end{align}
Or, equivalently,
\begin{equation}
  |\psi\rangle
  = \left[\hat{I} + \hat{G} \hat{V}\right] |\psi_i\rangle
  = \left[\hat{I} + \hat{G}_0 \hat{V} + (\hat{G}_0 \hat{V})^2 + (\hat{G}_0 \hat{V})^3 + \cdots\right]|\psi_i\rangle.
  \label{bornseries}
\end{equation}
This infinite series is called the \textbf{Born series}.

To interpret this result, let us go to the position basis:
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned}\psi(\mathbf{r}) = \psi_i(\mathbf{r}) &+ \int d^dr' \langle \mathbf{r} | \hat{G}_0 |\mathbf{r}'\rangle\, V(\mathbf{r}') \psi_i(\mathbf{r}') \\ &+ \int d^dr' d^dr'' \langle \mathbf{r} | \hat{G}_0 |\mathbf{r}'\rangle\, V(\mathbf{r}') \, \langle \mathbf{r}' | \hat{G}_0 |\mathbf{r}''\rangle \, V(\mathbf{r}'') \psi_i(\mathbf{r}'') \;\; + \;\;\cdots\end{aligned}
    \label{Bornposition}
\end{align}
This formula can be regarded as a description of \textbf{multiple
  scattering}.  Due to the presence of the scatterer, the particle
wavefunction is a quantum superposition of terms describing zero, one,
two, or more scattering events, as illustrated below:

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.98\textwidth]{bornseries}
\end{figure}

\noindent
Each successive term in the Born series involves more scattering
events, i.e., higher multiples of $\hat{V}$.  For example, the
second-order term is
\begin{equation*}
  \int d^dr' d^dr'' \langle \mathbf{r} | \hat{G}_0 |\mathbf{r}'\rangle\, V(\mathbf{r}') \, \langle \mathbf{r}' | \hat{G}_0 |\mathbf{r}''\rangle \, V(\mathbf{r}'') \psi_i(\mathbf{r}'').
\end{equation*}
This describes the particle undergoing (i) scattering of the incident
particle at point $\mathbf{r}''$, (ii) propagation from $\mathbf{r}''$
to $\mathbf{r}'$, (iii) scattering again at point $\mathbf{r}'$, and
(iv) propagation from $\mathbf{r}'$ to $\mathbf{r}$.  Note that
$\mathbf{r}'$ and $\mathbf{r}''$ are integrated over all possible
positions.  Since the integrals are weighted by $V$, the positions
with the strongest scattering potential contribute the most.

For a sufficiently weak scatterer, it is often a good approximation to
retain just the first few terms in the Born series.  The question of
when $\hat{V}$ is ``sufficiently weak''---i.e., when the Born series
converges---is a complex topic beyond the scope of our present
discussion.

\section{Green's function for a free particle}
\label{sec:freegreen}

In the position basis representation of the Born series,
Eq.~\eqref{Bornposition}, a crucial role is played by the matrix
elements $\langle\mathbf{r}|\hat{G}_0|\mathbf{r}'\rangle$.  We call
this the \textbf{propagator}, as it describes how the particle
propagates between discrete scattering events.

Starting from the definition of $\hat{G}_0$ in
Eq.~\eqref{G0unregulated}, we can evaluate it in the position basis:
\begin{align*}
  \langle\mathbf{r} |\big(E-\hat{H}_0\big) \hat{G}_0 |\mathbf{r}'\rangle &= \langle\mathbf{r}|\hat{I}|\mathbf{r}'\rangle \\
  = \left(E + \frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 \right) \langle\mathbf{r} |\hat{G}_0 |\mathbf{r}'\rangle &= \delta^d(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}')
\end{align*}
Hence,
\begin{equation}
  \left(\nabla^2 + k^2\right) \langle\mathbf{r} |\hat{G}_0 |\mathbf{r}'\rangle = \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \delta^d(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'),
  \;\;\; \mathrm{where}\;\; k = \sqrt{\frac{2mE}{\hbar^2}}.
  \label{propagatoreq}
\end{equation}
Note that the $\nabla^2$ acts on the $\mathbf{r}$ coordinates, not
$\mathbf{r}'$.

\textbf{Appendix A} provides an in-depth discussion of how to solve
Eq.~\eqref{propagatoreq}.  Here, we will skip over the details, but
there is one important bit to note.  During the derivation, it turns
out to be necessary to modify the Green's function definition by
replacing Eq.~\eqref{G0unregulated} with
\begin{framed}
  \begin{equation}
    \hat{G_0} = \lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow 0^+} \big(E - \hat{H}_0 + i \varepsilon\big)^{-1},
    \label{G0regulated}
  \end{equation}
\end{framed}
\vskip -0.1in
\noindent
This is called a \textbf{causal Green's function}; the word ``causal''
is based on the term ``cause and effect'', and the tweak is needed so
that $\hat{G_0}$ describes a wave that travels from a source at
$\mathbf{r}'$ (the \textit{cause}) to $\mathbf{r}$ (the
\textit{effect}), not vice versa.  For details, refer to Appendix A.


The resulting propagators for 1D, 2D,
and 3D are
\begin{framed}
  \begin{equation}
    \langle\mathbf{r}|\hat{G}_0|\mathbf{r}'\rangle = \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \times \begin{cases} \Bigg.\displaystyle\frac{1}{2ik} \exp\left(ik|x-x'|\right),& d=1\\ \Bigg. \displaystyle\frac{1}{4i} H^+_0(k|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'}|), & d=2 \\ \displaystyle \Bigg. - \frac{\exp\left(ik|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|\right)}{4\pi|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|}, & d = 3.  \end{cases}
    \label{propagator_solutions}
  \end{equation}
\end{framed}
\vskip -0.1in
\noindent
In the $d = 2$ case, $H_0^+$ denotes a Hankel function (see Appendix A
for details).

Treating $\mathbf{r}$ as wavefunction coordinates, the solution for
each $d$ describes a wave propagating outward isotropically from a
source point $\mathbf{r}'$.  In 1D, the propagator has the form of a
plane wave on each side, whereas in 2D it is a circular wave, and in
3D it is a spherical wave.  (To see why \eqref{G0regulated} gives rise
to outgoing solutions, note that because of the definition of $k$ in
Eq.~\eqref{propagatoreq}, the $\varepsilon$ term contributes an
infinitesimal positive imaginary part to $k$.  At large distances, the
outgoing waves in \eqref{propagator_solutions} go as $\exp(ikr)$, so
the correction to $k$ suppresses the wavefunction and makes it
integrable.)

%% Alternative tweaks to the Green's function produce different
%% behaviors.  For instance, we could flip the sign of $\varepsilon$
%% in Eq.~\eqref{G0regulated}.  This gives rise to an
%% \textbf{anti-causal Green's function}, whose solutions are
%% \textit{incoming} waves that arrive from infinity and are absorbed
%% into $\mathbf{r}'$.  In dealing with scattering problems, we
%% generally always use the causal Green's function.

\section{Scattering amplitudes in 3D}
\label{sec:3damp}

We are now in a position to combine the results of
Sections~\ref{sec:scattering_amplitude}--\ref{sec:freegreen}.  For
ease of presentation, we will focus on the 3D case; the 1D and 2D
cases are handled in a similar way.  Using Eqs.~\eqref{psis_implicity}
and \eqref{psiscat}, we can express the scattered wavefunction as
\begin{align}
  \psi_s(\mathbf{r})
  &= \langle\mathbf{r}| \hat{G}_0 \hat{V} |\psi\rangle \\
  &= \int d^3r'\; \langle\mathbf{r}|\hat{G}_0|\mathbf{r}'\rangle\, V(\mathbf{r}')\, \psi(\mathbf{r}')
  \;\;\overset{r\rightarrow\infty}{\longrightarrow}\;\;
  \Psi_i \, \frac{e^{ikr}}{r} \, f(\mathbf{k}_i\rightarrow k\hat{\mathbf{r}}).
  \label{psis_expansion}
\end{align}
Our goal is to determine the scattering amplitude $f$.  As we saw in
Sec.~\ref{sec:scattering_amplitude}, $f$ is the part of the scattering
experiment's results containing information about the scatterer (with
scatterer-independent bits, like the large-$r$ scaling, stripped
away).

From Eq.~\eqref{propagator_solutions}, the propagator in 3D is
\begin{equation}
  \langle\mathbf{r}|\hat{G}_0|\mathbf{r}'\rangle =
  - \frac{2m}{\hbar^2}
  \frac{\exp\left(ik|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|\right)}{4\pi|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|}.
\end{equation}
In the $r\rightarrow\infty$ limit, this can be simplified using the
Taylor expansion
\begin{equation}
  |\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}'| = r - \hat{\mathbf{r}} \cdot \mathbf{r}' + \cdots,
\end{equation}
where $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ is the unit vector pointing parallel to
$\mathbf{r}$.  (This is the same large-$r$ expansion used to derive
the electric dipole moment in classical electromagnetism.)  Hence, to
lowest order,
\begin{equation}
  \langle\mathbf{r}|\hat{G}_0|\mathbf{r}'\rangle \overset{r\rightarrow\infty}{\longrightarrow} - \frac{2m}{\hbar^2}\, \frac{e^{ikr}}{4\pi r}\; \exp\left(-ik \, \hat{\mathbf{r}} \cdot \mathbf{r}'\right).
\end{equation}
Applying this to the left side of Eq.~\eqref{psis_expansion} gives
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned}\psi_s(\mathbf{r})
    &\overset{r\rightarrow\infty}{\longrightarrow} \, - \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \, \frac{e^{ikr}}{4\pi r}\; \int d^3r' \exp\left(-ik \, \hat{\mathbf{r}} \cdot \mathbf{r}'\right)\, V(\mathbf{r}')\, \psi(\mathbf{r}') \\
    &\;\;=\;\; - \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \, \frac{e^{ikr}}{r} \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}} \; \big\langle \mathbf{k}_f \big|\hat{V}\big|\psi\big\rangle. \end{aligned}
\end{align}
On the second line, we simplified the expression by introducing the
momentum eigenstate with $\mathbf{k}_f \equiv k \hat{\mathbf{r}}$.
This corresponds to the ``final'' momentum of the scattered particle,
measured when the particle is picked up by a detector placed in the
$\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ direction relative to the origin.  Note that
$|\mathbf{k}_f| = |\mathbf{k}_i| = k$, consistent with elastic
scattering.

We can massage the result a bit more by using Eq.~\eqref{bornseries}
to write $|\psi\rangle = [\hat{I} + \hat{G}\hat{V}]|\psi_i\rangle$.
The incident state $|\psi_i\rangle$ is proportional to the momentum
eigenstate $|\mathbf{k}_i\rangle$, and we can work out the
proportionality factor by comparing Eqs.~\eqref{kwavefun} and
\eqref{psiin}.  The result is
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned}\psi_s(\mathbf{r}) \; &\overset{r\rightarrow\infty}{\longrightarrow} - \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \, \Psi_i\, \frac{e^{ikr}}{r} \; 2\pi^2 \; \big\langle \mathbf{k}_f \big|\hat{V} + \hat{V}\hat{G}\hat{V}\big|\mathbf{k}_i\big\rangle.\end{aligned}
\end{align}
By comparing this to the right side of Eq.~\eqref{psis_expansion}, we
can read off the scattering amplitude:
\begin{framed}
  \begin{align}
    \begin{aligned}
      f(\mathbf{k}_i \rightarrow \mathbf{k}_f) &= - \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \,\cdot \, 2\pi^2 \; \big\langle \mathbf{k}_f\big| \hat{V} + \hat{V}\hat{G} \hat{V} \big|\mathbf{k}_i\big\rangle \\
      &= - \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \,\cdot \, 2\pi^2 \; \big\langle \mathbf{k}_f\big| \hat{V} + \hat{V}\hat{G}_0 \hat{V} + \hat{V} \hat{G}_0 \hat{V} \hat{G}_0\hat{V} + \cdots \big|\mathbf{k}_i\big\rangle.  \end{aligned}
    \label{fresult}
  \end{align}
\end{framed}
\vskip -0.15in
\noindent
As noted above, this is subject to the elasticity constraint
$|\mathbf{k}_i| = |\mathbf{k}_f|$.  To get the infinite series on the
second line of Eq.~\eqref{fresult}, we used Eq.~\eqref{bornseries}.

Eq.~\eqref{fresult} is the culmination of numerous definitions and
derivations from the preceding sections.  On the left side is the
scattering amplitude, the fundamental quantity of interest in a
scattering experiment.  The right side contains the various inputs to
the scattering problem: the initial and final momenta, the scattering
potential, and the Green's function.  Although this result was derived
for the 3D case, very similar formulas hold for other dimensions, with
the $2\pi^2$ factor replaced with other numerical factors.

\section{Example: uniform spherical well in 3D}

Let us test the Born series with a simple scatterer.  Consider a
scattering potential that is a uniform spherical well of depth $U > 0$
and radius $R$:
\begin{equation}
  V(\mathbf{r}) = \begin{cases}-U, & |\mathbf{r}| \le R \\ \;\;\;\,0,
    & |\mathbf{r}| > 0. \end{cases}
\end{equation}

As it turns out, this particular scattering problem can be solved
exactly by exploiting the scattering potential's spherical symmetry.
The procedure is explained in \textbf{Appendix A}.  The result for the
scattering amplitude is
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}f(\mathbf{k}_i \rightarrow \mathbf{k}_f) &= \frac{1}{2ik}\, \sum_{\ell =0}^\infty \big(e^{2i\delta_\ell} - 1\big) \big(2\ell+1\big)\, P_{\ell}(\hat{\mathbf{k}}_i\cdot \hat{\mathbf{k}}_f), \\ \mathrm{where}\;\; \delta_\ell &= \frac{\pi}{2} + \mathrm{arg}\!\left[k {h_\ell^+}'(kR) \, j_\ell(qR) - qh_\ell^+(kR)\, j_\ell'(qR)\right], \\ q &= \sqrt{2m(E+U)/\hbar^2} \\ k &\equiv |\mathbf{k}_i| = |\mathbf{k}_f|.\end{aligned}
  \label{fresult_well}
\end{equation}
The solution is expressed in terms of the special functions $j_\ell$
(spherical Bessel function of the first kind), $h_\ell^+$ (spherical
Hankel function of the first kind), and $P_\ell$ (Legendre
polynomial).

We will pit this exact solution against the previously-derived Born
series result, Eq.~\eqref{fresult}:
\begin{equation}
  f(\mathbf{k}_i\rightarrow \mathbf{k}_f) = - \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \,\cdot \, 2\pi^2 \, \Bigg[\big\langle \mathbf{k}_f\big| \hat{V}|\mathbf{k}_i\big\rangle + \big\langle \mathbf{k}_f \big| \hat{V}\hat{G}_0 \hat{V} \big|\mathbf{k}_i\big\rangle + \cdots \Bigg].
  \label{fexpression}
\end{equation}
Evaluating the full infinite Born series is generally an intractable
problem, but we can truncate it to get an approximation for $f$.  For
example, if we keep only the first term, the result is called the
\textbf{first Born approximation}; if we keep only the first two
terms, we obtain the \textbf{second Born approximation}.  To evaluate
the various bra-kets, we can use the position representation to
express them as explicit integrals.  For example,
\begin{align}
  \big\langle \mathbf{k}_f\big| \hat{V}|\mathbf{k}_i\big\rangle
  &= \int d^3r_1\; \frac{\exp(-i\mathbf{k}_f \cdot \mathbf{r}_1)}{(2\pi)^{3/2}} \, V(\mathbf{r}_1) \, \frac{\exp(i\mathbf{k}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_1)}{(2\pi)^{3/2}}
  \nonumber \\
  &= - \frac{U}{8\pi^3} \int_{|\mathbf{r}_1| \le R} d^3r_1 \; \exp\left[i(\mathbf{k}_i-\mathbf{k}_f)\, \cdot\, \mathbf{r}_1\right] \label{singleint}\\
  \big\langle \mathbf{k}_f \big| \hat{V}\hat{G}_0 \hat{V} \big|\mathbf{k}_i\big\rangle &=
  \int d^3r_1 \!\! \int d^3r_2 \; \frac{\exp(-i\mathbf{k}_f \cdot \mathbf{r}_2)}{(2\pi)^{3/2}} \, V(\mathbf{r}_2) \, \langle\mathbf{r}_2|\hat{G}_0|\mathbf{r}_1 \rangle \, V(\mathbf{r}_1)\, \frac{\exp(i\mathbf{k}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_1)}{(2\pi)^{3/2}} \nonumber \\
  &= - \frac{U^2}{32\pi^4} \, \frac{2m}{\hbar^2}\, \int_{|\mathbf{r}_1|<R} d^3 r_1 \int_{|\mathbf{r}_2|<R} d^3 r_2 \; \frac{\exp\left[i(k|\mathbf{r}_1-\mathbf{r}_2| - \mathbf{k}_f \cdot \mathbf{r}_2 +\mathbf{k}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_1)\right]}{|\mathbf{r}_1-\mathbf{r}_2|}.
  \label{doubleint}
\end{align}

To evaluate the integrals, an expedient approach is
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_integration}{Monte
  Carlo integration}.  For instance, the integral \eqref{singleint}
has the form
\begin{equation}
  I = \int_{|\mathrm{r}|<R} d^3r \, F(\mathbf{r}).
\end{equation}
To compute this, we randomly sample $N$ points within a cube of volume
$(2R)^3$ centered at the origin.  Note that this cube encloses the
radius-$R$ sphere over which the integral is meant to be taken.  For
each sampled point, $\mathbf{r}^{(n)}$, we compute
\begin{equation}
  F_n = \begin{cases}F(\mathbf{r}^{(n)}), & |\mathbf{r}^{(n)}| < R \\ 0, &\mathrm{otherwise},\end{cases}
\end{equation}
which drops contributions from points outside the sphere.  Then our
estimate for $I$ is
\begin{equation}
  I \,\approx\, (2R)^3 \, \langle F_n\rangle \,=\, \frac{(2R)^3}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N F_n.
  \label{Iest}
\end{equation}
The estimate converges to the true value as $N\rightarrow\infty$.  In
practice, $N \sim 10^4$ yields a good result for typical 3D integrals,
and can be calculated in seconds on a modern computer.

Similarly, to calculate a double integral like Eq.~\eqref{doubleint},
we sample \textit{pairs} of points, $(\mathbf{r}_1^{(n)},
\mathbf{r}_2^{(n)})$, and replace the volume factor $(2R)^3$ in
Eq.~\eqref{Iest} with $(2R)^6$.  The rest of the estimation procedure
is the same.

Evidently, this method does not assume that the scattering potential
has any particular symmetry.  It is therefore applicable to
complicated scattering potentials for which there are no exact
solutions like Eq.~\eqref{fresult_well}.

In the figure below, we compare the Born approximation to the exact
solution \eqref{fresult_well} for the 3D potential well.  We plot
$|f|^2$ versus the energy $E$ at a $90^\circ$ scattering angle (i.e.,
$\mathbf{k}_f$ perpendicular to $\mathbf{k}_i$), for fixed well radius
$R = 1$ and two different well depths $U = 0.1$ and $U = 1$.  We adopt
computational units $\hbar = m = 1$, and each Monte Carlo integral is
computed using $3\times10^4$ samples.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.97\textwidth]{spherical_well_scattering}
\end{figure}

The first thing to notice is that $|f|^2$ diminishes to zero for large
$E$.  This makes sense: the scattering potential has some energy scale
$\sim U$, so a particle with energy $E \gg U$ should simply zoom
through, with little chance of being deflected.

Looking more closely, we see that for the shallower well ($U = 0.1$),
the first Born approximation agrees pretty well with the exact
results, while the second Born approximation agrees extremely well.
The second Born approximation is significantly more accurate than the
first Born approximation at small values of $E$.

However, for the deeper well ($U = 1$), neither the first nor second
Born approximations do a good job.  Roughly speaking, the deep
potential well allows the particle to bounce inside many times before
escaping (see Sec.~\ref{sec:greensfun}), which means that higher terms
in the Born series are important and cannot be neglected.

In fact, for very strong scattering potentials, even taking the Born
approximation to high orders may not work, as the Born series may
become non-convergent.  In such cases, different methods must be
brought to bear.  We will see an example in the next chapter.

\section*{Exercises}

\begin{enumerate}
\item In Sec.~\ref{sec:waves}, we derived the eigenstates of a
  particle in an empty infinite space by considering a box of length
  $L$ on each side, applying periodic boundary conditions, and taking
  $L \rightarrow \infty$.  Suppose we instead use Dirichlet boundary
  conditions (i.e., the wavefunction vanishes on the walls of the
  box).  Show that this gives rise to the same set of momentum
  eigenstates in the $L \rightarrow \infty$ limit.

\item Using the results for the 1D delta-function scattering problem
  described in Section~\ref{sec:1dscatter}, calculate the probability
  current
  \begin{equation}
    J(x) = \frac{\hbar}{2mi}\left(\psi^*\frac{d\psi}{dx} - \psi\frac{d\psi^*}{dx}\right),
  \end{equation}
  where $\psi(x)$ is the \textit{total} (incident + scattered)
  wavefunction.  Explain the relationship between the values of $J$ on
  the left and right side of the scatterer.

\item Derive the Green's function for a free particle in 1D space:

    \langle x|\hat{G}_0|x'\rangle = \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \cdot \frac{1}{2ik_i} \exp\left(ik_i|x-x'|\right).
  \end{equation}

\item In Section~\ref{sec:3damp}, the scattering amplitude
  $f(\mathrm{k}\rightarrow\mathrm{k}')$ for the 3D scattering problem

%% For decades after the discovery of quantum mechanics, the quantum
%% double-slit experiment was just a ``thought experiment'', meant to
%% illustrate the features of quantum mechanics that had been uncovered
%% by other, more complicated experiments.  Nowadays, the most convenient
%% way to do the experiment is with light, using single-photon sources
%% and single-photon detectors.  Quantum interference has also been
%% demonstrated experimentally using electrons, neutrons, and even
%% large-scale particles such as buckyballs.
