\section{Bound states and free states}

A curious feature of wavefunctions in infinite space is that they come
in two distinct varieties: (i) \textbf{bound states} that are
localized to one region of space, like the ground state of a harmonic
oscillator, and (ii) \textbf{free states} that extend over the whole
space, like plane waves.  In fact, both kinds of states can co-exist
in a single system.

A simple model exhibiting this is the \textbf{1D finite square well}.
Consider the Hamiltonian
\begin{equation}
  \hat{H} = \frac{\hat{p}^2}{2m} - U \,\Theta(a -|\hat{x}|),
\end{equation}
where $\hat{x}$ and $\hat{p}$ are 1D position and momentum operators,
$m$ is the particle mass, $U$ and $a$ are positive real parameters
governing the potential function, and $\Theta$ denotes the Heaviside
step function (i.e., 1 if the input is positive, and 0 otherwise).  As
shown below, the potential forms a well of depth $U$ and width $2a$,
and vanishes elsewhere.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.55\textwidth]{squarewell}
\end{figure}

For such a Hamiltonian, the time-independent Schr\"odinger wave
equation can be solved efficiently using a technique called the
\textbf{transfer matrix method}.  Here, we will describe a few key
aspects of the calculation, bypassing most of the details.  For a more
detailed discussion of the transfer matrix method, refer to Appendix
B.

We begin by noting that deriving solutions to the Schr\"odinger wave
equation, like any other differential equation, requires us to specify
boundary conditions.

If we are interested in bound state solutions, we look for
wavefunctions that diminish exponentially as $x \rightarrow
\pm\infty$.  For $|x| > a$, the Schr\"odinger wave equation reduces to
\begin{equation}
  -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\,\frac{d^2\psi}{dx^2} = E \psi(x),
  \label{eq:psioutside}
\end{equation}
subject to the boundary conditions
\begin{equation}
  \psi(x) \sim e^{\mp\kappa x} \;\; \textrm{as} \;\; x \rightarrow \pm \infty
  \label{eq:expout}
\end{equation}
for some real $\kappa$.  The functions satisfying
Eqs.~\eqref{eq:psioutside} and \eqref{eq:expout} are
\begin{equation}
  \psi(x) = c_\pm\, e^{\mp\kappa x}, \;\;\mathrm{where}\;\, -\frac{\hbar^2\kappa^2}{2m} = E, \;\; c_\pm \in \mathbb{C}.
\end{equation}
Evidently, such a solution requires $E < 0$.  Moreover, the
variational principle implies that $E \ge -U$, so the bound state
energies are restricted to the range $-U \le E < 0$.

It is also possible to show that the bound state energies are
\textit{discrete}, and that each bound state wavefunction can always
be normalized:
\begin{equation}
  \int_{-\infty}^\infty |\psi(x)|^2\, dx\; =\; 1.
\end{equation}
The normalization integral is finite since $|\psi(x)|^2$ vanishes
exponentially for $x \rightarrow \pm \infty$.  These two properties
follow from the analysis of the general class of
``Sturm-Liouville-type'' differential equations; for details, refer to
textbooks such as Courant and Hilbert [\ref{cite:CourantHilbert}].

For a free state, the situation is quite different.  In this case, the
wavefunction does not vanish exponentially at infinity, but instead
takes the form
\begin{equation}
  \psi(x) = \begin{cases} \alpha_-\, e^{ik x} + \beta_-\, e^{-ik x}, & \;\;\;x < -a\\ (\mathrm{something}) , & -a < x < a\\ \alpha_+\, e^{ik x} + \beta_+\, e^{-ik x} , & \;\;\,x > a\end{cases}
\end{equation}
for some real $k$.  Right now, we are not concerned about how
$\psi(x)$ behaves in the well region $-a < x < a$.  We focus on the
outside region, where $\psi(x)$ consists of superpositions of
left-moving and right-moving plane waves.  To satisfy Schr\"odinger's
equation here, we need
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\hbar^2k^2}{2m} = E,
\end{equation}
which implies that $E \ge 0$.  For each $E$, the coefficients
$\alpha_\pm$ and $\beta_\pm$ are not independent, but are linked by a
linear relation (see Appendix B).  Unlike the bound states, the free
states are not discrete; there exist free states for \textit{every} $E
\ge 0$.

Moreover, since $|\psi(x)|^2$ does not diminish at infinity, the
integral $\int_{-\infty}^\infty |\psi(x)|^2\, dx$ is divergent, so
these wavefunctions cannot be normalized to unity.

The following figure shows numerically-obtained results for a square
well with $U = 30$ and $a=1$ (in units where $\hbar = m =1$).  The
energy spectrum is shown on the left side.  There exist five bound
states; their plots of $|\psi|^2$ versus $x$ are shown on the right
side.  These results were computed using the transfer matrix method
described in Appendix B.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.76\textwidth]{boundvsextended}
\end{figure}

Many of the lessons drawn from the square well model can be
generalized to more complicated potentials.  In cases where the
potential at infinity is $V_{\textrm{ext}}$ rather than zero, free
states occur for $E \ge V_{\textrm{ext}}$ and bound states occur for
$\textrm{min}(V) < E < V_{\textrm{ext}}$.

There is an important proviso to bear in mind.  If we vary the
potential, the number of bound states can change: i.e., bound state
solutions can either appear or disappear.  A numerical example is
given below, showing the bound state energies for the square well
model with fixed $a = 1$, as we vary the potential minimum $-U$:

\vskip 0.15in
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.71\textwidth]{boundstate1d}
\end{figure}

\noindent
For $U = 30$, there are five bound states, which disappear one by one
as we make the potential well shallower.  Note that one bound state
survives in the limit $U \rightarrow 0$.  There is a theorem stating
that any 1D attractive potential, no matter how weak, always supports
at least one bound state.  For details, see
\hyperref[ex:boundstate]{Exercise 1}.

In 3D, it is possible for an attractive potential to be too weak to
support a bound state.  Intuitively, this happens when the zero-point
energy of a prospective ground state exceeds the well depth.  The
figure below shows a numerical example, calculated for a uniform 3D
spherically symmetric well (the $l$'s labeling the various curves are
angular momentum quantum numbers).  To learn more about this
phenomenon, refer to \hyperref[ex:boundstate3d]{Exercise 2}.

\section{Quasi-bound states and resonances}
\label{sec:resonances}

For the 1D finite square well, there is a clear distinction between
bound and free states.  Certain potentials, however, can host special
states called ``\textbf{quasi-bound states}''.  Like a bound state, a
quasi-bound state is strongly concentrated in one region of space, yet
it lies within the energy range of the free states continuum.  As we
shall see, quasi-bound states play an important important role in
scattering experiments.

The figure below shows an example of a potential function that gives
rise to quasi-bound states.  In the exterior region, $|x| > b$, the
potential is zero.  Between $x = -b$ and $x = b$, there is a
``barrier'' of positive potential $V_b$.  Embedded in the middle of
this barrier is a central well of depth $U$ and width $2a$, such that
$0 < V_b - U < V_b$.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{resonancewell}
\end{figure}

\noindent
The potential is purely repulsive (i.e., $V \ge 0$ everywhere), so
there are no true bound states.  All the exact eigenstates of the
Hamiltonian must be free states.

However, there is something intriguing about the central well.
Consider an alternative scenario where the potential in the exterior
region is $V_b$ rather than $0$, so that
\begin{equation}
  V_{\mathrm{alt}}(x) = \begin{cases}V_b - U, & |x| < a, \\ V_b, & \mathrm{otherwise}.\end{cases}
\end{equation}
This describes a finite square well, which should have one or more
bound states in the energy range $V_b-U < E < V_b$.  For each of these
bound states, the wavefunction $\psi(x)$ diminishes exponentially away
from the well, so $\psi(x) \approx 0$ for $|x| > b$.  But $V(x)$ and
$V_{\mathrm{alt}}(x)$ differ only in the region $|x| > b$, which
implies that $\psi(x)$ is a good \textit{approximate} solution to the
Schr\"odinger equation for the original potential $V(x)$, in spite of
the fact that $V(x)$ does not support true bound states!  We call such
an approximate solution a quasi-bound state.

We can also analyze the situation using the scattering framework from
the previous chapter.  Consider an incident particle of energy $E > 0$
whose wavefunction is
\begin{equation}
  \psi_i(x) = \Psi_i \, e^{ik_i x}.
\end{equation}
This produces a scattered wavefunction, which takes the following form
in the exterior region:
\begin{equation}
  \psi_s(x) = \Psi_i \times \begin{cases}f_- \,e^{-ik_ix}, & x \le -b \\ f_+ \,e^{ik_ix}, & x \ge b.\end{cases}
\end{equation}
The scattering amplitudes $f_+$ and $f_-$ can be found by solving the
Schr\"odinger wave equation using the transfer matrix method (see
Appendix B).  The figure below shows numerical results obtained for $U
= 20,\,V_b = 30,\,a=1$, and $b \in \{ 1.2, 1.4\}$, with $\hbar = m =
1$.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{resonances}
\end{figure}

\noindent
The vertical axis shows $|1+f_+|^2$, which is called the
``transmittance'' and corresponds to the probability for the incident
particle to pass through the potential.  The horizontal axis is the
particle energy $E$.  For $E < V_b-U$, the transmittance approaches
zero, and for $E \gtrsim V_b$, the transmittance approaches unity, as
expected.  In the energy range $V_b-U < E \lesssim V_b$, the
transmittance forms a series of narrow peaks.  For larger $b$ (i.e.,
when the central well is more isolated from the exterior space), the
peaks are narrower.  At the top of the figure, we have also plotted
the bound state energies for the square well potential
$V_{\mathrm{alt}}(x)$.  These energies closely match the locations of
the transmittance peaks!

Upon examining the total wavefunction $\psi(x)$ at these special
energies, we find other interesting features.  The figure below plots
$|\psi(x)|^2$ versus $x$ at the energies of the first three
transmittance peaks, along with the corresponding bound state
wavefunctions for the square well $V_{\mathrm{alt}}$.  At each
transmittance peak, $|\psi(x)|^2$ is much larger within the potential
region, and its shape is very similar to a square well bound state.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{resonancewavefunctions}
\end{figure}

\noindent
The enhancement of $|\psi(x)|^2$ is called a \textbf{resonance}, and
is due to the presence of a quasi-bound state.  Roughly speaking, the
incident particle enters the scattering region, and spends a long time
trapped in the quasi-bound state, before eventually leaking out and
escaping to infinity.

This is analogous to the phenomenon of resonance in a classical
harmonic oscillator.  When a damped harmonic oscillator is subjected
to an oscillatory driving force, it settles into a steady-state
oscillatory motion at the driving frequency.  If the driving frequency
matches the oscillator's natural frequency (i.e., the frequency of
free oscillation in the absence of a drive), then the oscillation
amplitude becomes large, and the system is said to be ``resonant''.
In the quantum mechanical context, the incident wavefunction plays the
role of a driving force, the incident particle energy is like the
driving frequency, and the energy of a quasi-bound state is like the
natural frequency of oscillation.

Resonances play a critical role throughout experimental physics.
Experiments are often conducted for the express purpose of locating
and studying resonances.  When a resonance peak is found, its location
and shape can be used to deduce various features of the quasi-bound
state, which in turn supplies important information about the
underlying system.

\section{Green's function analysis of scattering resonances}
\label{sec:green_resonances}

Quasi-bound states and resonances are not limited to 1D, but are
equally (or more) important in 2D and 3D.  A useful and general way to
study them is the quantum Green's function formalism developed in the
previous chapter.

Let $\hat{H} = \hat{T} + \hat{V}$ be the Hamiltonian of a system
supporting resonances, where $\hat{T}$ is the kinetic energy operator
and $\hat{V}$ is the potential operator.  We decompose the potential
into
\begin{equation}
  \hat{V} = \hat{V}_0 + \hat{V}_1,
\end{equation}
where $\hat{V}_0$ is a ``confining potential'' that supports a bound
state, and $\hat{V}_1$ is a ``deconfining potential'' that turns the
bound state into a quasi-bound state.  For example, the figure below
shows the potential functions for the 1D model discussed in the
previous section:

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.99\textwidth]{resonancewell_decomp}
\end{figure}

When the potential is just $\hat{V}_0$, let there be a bound state
$|\varphi\rangle$ with energy $E_0$.  Furthermore, let us assume that
the potential supports a continuum of free states $\{|\psi_k\rangle\}$
with energies $\{E_k\}$, where $k$ is some continuous index (analogous
to the wave-vector for plane wave states).  The bound state and free
states satisfy the Schr\"odinger equation
\begin{align}
  \big(\hat{T} + \hat{V}_0\big) |\varphi\rangle \; &= E_0 |\varphi\rangle \\ \big(\hat{T} + \hat{V}_0\big) |\psi_k\rangle &= E_k |\psi_k\rangle,
\end{align}
along with the orthogonality and completeness relations
\begin{equation}
  \langle\varphi|\psi_k\rangle = 0, \quad |\varphi\rangle\langle\varphi| + \int d^dk\, |\psi_k\rangle\langle\psi_k| = \hat{I}.
\end{equation}
As described in Section~VII of the previous chapter, the causal
Green's function is
\begin{equation}
  \hat{G}_0(E) = \lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow0^+} \Big(E - \hat{T} - \hat{V}_0 + i\varepsilon\Big)^{-1}.
\end{equation}

Now introduce the deconfining potential $\hat{V}_1$.  According to
Dyson's equations (Section~VI of the previous chapter), the Green's
function for the full system is
\begin{equation}
  \hat{G} = \hat{G}_0 + \hat{G} \hat{V}_1 \hat{G}_0.
\end{equation}
We want the matrix elements of $\hat{G}(E)$, which can then be used to
find scattering amplitudes.  We will calculate them by using the
states $|\varphi\rangle$ and $\{|\psi_k\rangle\}$ as a basis---but
note that this basis does \textit{not} consist of energy
eigenfunctions of the full Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$.  In particular,
$|\varphi\rangle$ is not an exact eigenstate of $\hat{H}$.

As usual when dealing with Dyson's equations, we must watch out for
the fact that $\hat{G}$ appears on both the left and right hand sides.
This can be dealt with by judiciously inserting a resolution of the
identity:
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned}\hat{G} &= \hat{G}_0 + \hat{G} \hat{I} \hat{V}_1 \hat{G}_0 \\ &= \hat{G}_0 + \hat{G} \left(|\varphi\rangle\langle\varphi| + \int d^dk\, |\psi_k\rangle\langle\psi_k|\right) \hat{V}_1 \hat{G}_0. \end{aligned}
\end{align}
We now compute the matrix element
$\langle\varphi|\cdots|\varphi\rangle$ for both sides of the equation:
\begin{align}
    \langle\varphi|\hat{G}|\varphi\rangle = \langle\varphi|\hat{G}_0|\varphi\rangle &+ \langle\varphi|\hat{G}|\varphi\rangle \, \langle\varphi|\hat{V}_1 \hat{G}_0|\varphi\rangle + \int d^dk\, \langle\varphi|\hat{G}|\psi_k\rangle \, \langle\psi_k| \hat{V}_1 \hat{G}_0|\varphi\rangle \nonumber\\
    \langle\varphi|\hat{G}|\varphi\rangle \left(1 - \langle\varphi|\hat{V}_1 \hat{G}_0|\varphi\rangle\right) &= \langle\varphi|\hat{G}_0|\varphi\rangle + \int d^dk\, \langle\varphi|\hat{G}|\psi_k\rangle \, \langle\psi_k| \hat{V}_1 \hat{G}_0|\varphi\rangle \nonumber\\
    \lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow0^+}
    \langle\varphi|\hat{G}|\varphi\rangle \left(1 - \frac{\langle\varphi|\hat{V}_1|\varphi\rangle}{E - E_0 + i\varepsilon}\right) &= \lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow0^+} \frac{1}{E  - E_0 + i\varepsilon} \left(1+ \int d^dk\, \langle\varphi|\hat{G}|\psi_k\rangle \, \langle\psi_k| \hat{V}_1|\varphi\rangle \right) \nonumber\\
    \lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow0^+} \langle\varphi|\hat{G}|\varphi\rangle \Big(E - E_0 -\, \langle\varphi|\hat{V}_1|\varphi\rangle \, & + i\varepsilon\Big) - \int d^dk\, \langle\varphi|\hat{G}|\psi_k\rangle \, \langle\psi_k| \hat{V}_1|\varphi\rangle = 1. \label{psiGphi}
\end{align}
Similarly, computing the matrix element
$\langle\varphi|\cdots|\psi_k\rangle$ gives:
\begin{align*}
  \begin{aligned}
\langle\varphi|\hat{G}|\psi_k\rangle &= \langle\varphi|\hat{G}_0|\psi_k\rangle + \langle\varphi|\hat{G}|\varphi\rangle \, \langle\varphi|\hat{V}_1 \hat{G}_0|\psi_k\rangle + \int d^dk'\, \langle\varphi|\hat{G}|\psi_{k'}\rangle \, \langle\psi_{k'}| \hat{V}_1 \hat{G}_0|\psi_k\rangle \\
&= \lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow0^+} \left(E-E_k+i\varepsilon\right)^{-1} \left(\langle\varphi|\hat{G}|\varphi\rangle \, \langle\varphi|\hat{V}_1|\psi_k\rangle + \int d^dk'\, \langle\varphi|\hat{G}|\psi_{k'}\rangle \, \langle\psi_{k'}| \hat{V}_1|\psi_k\rangle\right).\end{aligned}
\end{align*}
The equations thus far have been exact (we have \textit{not} used
perturbation theory).  Now we apply an approximation: in the last line
of the above equation, let the factor of
$\langle\varphi|G|\varphi\rangle$ be large, so that the first term in
the sum becomes dominant.  It will be shown below that
$\langle\varphi|G|\varphi\rangle$ being large is precisely the
resonance condition, so this approximation will be self-consistent.
With this, we obtain
\begin{equation}
  \langle\varphi|\hat{G}|\psi_k\rangle \approx \lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow0^+} \frac{\langle\varphi|\hat{G}|\varphi\rangle \, \langle\varphi|\hat{V}_1|\psi_k\rangle}{E-E_k+i\varepsilon}.
\end{equation}
Combining this with Eq.~\eqref{psiGphi} gives
\begin{equation*}
  \lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow0^+} \left[\langle\varphi|\hat{G}|\varphi\rangle \left(E - E_0 -\, \langle\varphi|\hat{V}_1|\varphi\rangle \, + i\varepsilon\right) - \int d^dk\, \frac{\langle\varphi|\hat{G}|\varphi\rangle\langle\varphi|\hat{V}_1|\psi_k\rangle}{E-E_k+i\varepsilon} \, \langle\psi_k| \hat{V}_1|\varphi\rangle\right] \approx 1.
\end{equation*}
Hence,
\begin{framed}
  \begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
      \langle\varphi|\,\hat{G}(E)\,|\varphi\rangle \approx \frac{1}{\displaystyle E - E_0 - \langle\varphi|V_1|\varphi\rangle - \Sigma(E)} \\
      \mathrm{where}\;\;\Sigma(E) \equiv \lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow0^+} \int d^dk\, \frac{\displaystyle| \langle\psi_k| \hat{V}_1|\varphi\rangle|^2}{\displaystyle E-E_k+i\varepsilon}.
    \end{aligned}
    \label{phiGphi_result}
  \end{equation}
\end{framed}
\vskip -0.12in
The quantity $\Sigma(E)$ is called the \textbf{self-energy}, and we
will have more to say about it shortly.  It depends on $E$, but let us
assume for now that the dependence is weak, so that $\Sigma$ can be
effectively treated as a constant.  It is complex-valued, and both its
real and imaginary parts are important; we will shortly show that
$\mathrm{Im}(\Sigma) < 0$.

From Eq.~\eqref{phiGphi_result}, we can see that
$\langle\varphi|\hat{G}(E)|\varphi\rangle$ is large when the
denominator is as close to zero as possible.  This is called the
\textbf{resonance condition}, and is self-consistent with the
approximation that we made in the above derivation.  As we vary the
incident energy $E$ over the range of real values, the resonance
condition is satisfied when
\begin{equation}
  E \;\approx\; E_{\mathrm{res}} \,\equiv\, E_0 + \langle\varphi|\hat{V}_1|\varphi\rangle + \mathrm{Re}\big[\,\Sigma\,\big].
\end{equation}
We call $E_{\mathrm{res}}$ the \textbf{resonance energy}.  Its first
term is the energy of the original bound state, in the absence of the
deconfining potential $\hat{V}_1$.  The second term is the energy
shift induced by $\hat{V}_1$.  The third term is equal to the real
part of the self-energy $\Sigma$, and has a more subtle meaning.
Since the definition of $\Sigma$ involves $\{|\psi_k\rangle\}$, we can
think of this term as an energy shift induced by the continuum of free
states.

In Section VIII of the previous chapter, we derived the following
relationship between the Green's function and the scattering amplitude
$f$:
\begin{equation}
  f(\mathbf{k}\rightarrow\mathbf{k}') \;\propto\; \langle \mathbf{k}'|\hat{V}|\mathbf{k}\rangle + \langle \mathbf{k}'|\hat{V}\hat{G}\hat{V}|\mathbf{k}\rangle.
\end{equation}
Here, $|\mathbf{k}\rangle$ and $|\mathbf{k}'\rangle$ are incident and
scattered plane-wave states satisfying $|\mathbf{k}|=|\mathbf{k}'|$.
The first term describes the lowest-order scattering process (the
first Born approximation).  The second term contains all second- and
higher-order scattering processes.  By inserting resolutions of the
identity between each $\hat{V}$ and $\hat{G}$ operator in the second
term, we find that $f$ contains a contribution of the form
\begin{equation}
  \Delta f(\mathbf{k}\rightarrow\mathbf{k}') \;\propto\; \langle \mathbf{k}'|\hat{V}|\varphi\rangle\langle\varphi|\hat{G}|\varphi\rangle\langle\varphi|\hat{V}|\mathbf{k}\rangle \;=\; \frac{\langle \mathbf{k}'|\hat{V}|\varphi\rangle \, \langle\varphi|\hat{V}|\mathbf{k}\rangle}{\displaystyle E - E_{\mathrm{res}} - i \mathrm{Im}[\,\Sigma\,]}.
  \label{deltaf}
\end{equation}
At resonance, the denominator becomes small and hence $\Delta f$
should be the dominant contribution to $f$.  It is worth emphasizing
that $\Delta f$ is extracted from a combination of \textit{all} terms
in the Born series, not just low-order terms.  Intuitively, we can
think of a resonant scattering scenario as one where the particle
bounces around inside the potential many times before it finally
escapes---i.e., high orders in the Born series are significant.

The figure below shows the energy dependence of $\Delta f$, according
to Eq.~\eqref{deltaf}:

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=0.67\textwidth]{resonance}  
\end{center}

\noindent
The graph of $|\Delta f|^2$ versus $E$ has a shape known as a
\textbf{Lorentzian}.  It has a peak centered at the resonance energy
$E_{\mathrm{res}}$.  The peak width is characterized by the
\textbf{full-width at half-maximum} (FWHM), the spacing between the
two energies where $|\Delta f|^2$ is at half its maximum value:
\begin{equation}
  \delta E^{(\mathrm{FWHM})} = 2\, \Big|\mathrm{Im}[\Sigma]\Big|.
\end{equation}
Thus, the closer the self-energy gets to being a real quantity, the
sharper the peak.

The phase $\mathrm{arg}[\Delta f]$ also contains useful information.
As $E$ crosses $E_{\mathrm{res}}$ from below, the phase increases by
$\pi$.  The energy range over which this phase shift occurs is $\sim
|\mathrm{Im}[\Sigma]|$.

These two signatures---peaks and phase shifts---are sought after in
numerous real-world scattering experiments.  In actual experiments,
the peaks and phase shifts are often overlaid on a ``background''
caused by non-resonant effects.  For example, the plot below was
released by the CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC),
showing a resonance peak on a large background.  This was part of the
evidence for the LHC's discovery of a new particle, the Higgs boson,
in 2012.

\section{Fermi's Golden Rule}
\label{sec:goldenrule}

We have seen that the width of a resonance is determined by the
imaginary part of the self-energy, $\mathrm{Im}[\Sigma]$.  In this
section, we will show that $\mathrm{Im}[\Sigma]$ has a physical
meaning: it represents the \textbf{decay rate} of a quasi-bound state.
Moreover, it can be approximated using a simple but important formula
known as \textbf{Fermi's Golden Rule}.

Suppose we set the quantum state of a particle to a quasi-bound state
$|\varphi\rangle$ at some initial time $t = 0$.  Since
$|\varphi\rangle$ is not an exact eigenstate of the Hamiltonian, the
particle will not remain in that state under time evolution.  For $t >
0$, its wavefunction should become less and less localized, which can
be interpreted as the escape of the particle to infinity or the
``decay'' of the quasi-bound state into the free state continuum.

The decay process can be described by
\begin{equation}
  P(t) = \Big|\langle\varphi|\exp\left(-i\hat{H}t/\hbar\right)|\varphi\rangle\Big|^2,
\end{equation}
which is the probability for the system to continue occupying state
$|\varphi\rangle$ after time $t$.  In order to calculate $P(t)$, let
us define the function
\begin{equation}
  f(t) = \begin{cases} \langle\varphi|\exp\left(-i\hat{H}t/\hbar\right)|\varphi\rangle \,e^{-\varepsilon t}, & t \ge 0 \\ 0, & t < 0,\end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $\varepsilon \in \mathbb{R}^+$.  For $t \ge 0$ and $\varepsilon
\rightarrow 0^+$, we see that $|f(t)|^2 \rightarrow P(t)$.  The reason
we deal with $f(t)$ is that it is more well-behaved than the actual
amplitude $\langle\varphi|\exp(-i\hat{H}t/\hbar)|\varphi\rangle$.  The
function is designed so that firstly, it vanishes at negative times
prior to start of our thought experiment; and secondly, it vanishes as
$t\rightarrow\infty$ due to the ``regulator'' $\varepsilon$.  The
latter enforces the idea that the bound state decays permanently into
the continuum of free states, and is never re-populated by waves
``bouncing back'' from infinity.

We can determine $f(t)$ by first studying its Fourier transform,
\begin{equation}
  F(\omega) \;=\; \int_{-\infty}^\infty dt \; e^{i\omega t}\, f(t) \;=\; \int_0^\infty dt \; e^{i(\omega + i\varepsilon) t} \; \langle\varphi|e^{-i\hat{H}t/\hbar}|\varphi\rangle.
\end{equation}
Now insert a resolution of the identity, $\hat{I} = \sum_n
|n\rangle\langle n|$, where $\{|n\rangle\}$ denotes the exact
eigenstates of $\hat{H}$ (for free states, the sum goes to an integral
in the usual way):
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned}F(\omega) &= \int_0^\infty dt \; e^{i(\omega + i\varepsilon) t} \; \sum_n \langle\varphi|e^{-i\hat{H}t/\hbar}|n\rangle\langle n|\varphi\rangle \\ &= \sum_n \langle\varphi|n\rangle \left( \int_0^\infty dt \; \exp\left[i\left(\omega - \frac{E_n}{\hbar} + i\varepsilon\right) t\right] \right) \langle n|\varphi\rangle \\ &= \sum_n \langle\varphi|n\rangle \frac{i}{\omega - \frac{E_n}{\hbar} + i \varepsilon} \langle n|\varphi\rangle \\ &= i \hbar\; \langle \varphi | \left(\hbar\omega - \hat{H} + i\hbar\varepsilon \right)^{\!-1} | \varphi\rangle. \end{aligned}
\end{align}
In the third line, the regulator $\varepsilon$ removes any
contribution from the $t \rightarrow\infty$ limit of the integral, in
accordance with our requirement that the decay of the bound state is
permanent.  Hence, we obtain
\begin{equation}
  \lim_{\varepsilon \rightarrow 0^+} F(\omega) = i \hbar \, \langle \varphi | \hat{G}(\hbar\omega) | \varphi\rangle,
\end{equation}
where $\hat{G}$ is our old friend the causal Green's function.  The
fact that the \textit{causal} Green's function shows up is due to our
definition of $f(t)$, which vanishes for $t < 0$.

As discussed in the previous section, when the resonance condition is
satisfied,
\begin{equation}
  \langle\varphi|\,\hat{G}(E)\,|\varphi\rangle \approx \frac{1}{\displaystyle E - E_{\mathrm{res}} - i \mathrm{Im}[\Sigma]},
\end{equation}
where $E_{\mathrm{res}}$ is the resonance energy and $\Sigma$ is the
self-energy of the quasi-bound state.  We can now perform the
inverse Fourier transform
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned} \lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow 0^+} f(t) &= \lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow 0^+} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{d\omega}{2\pi} \; e^{-i\omega t} \, F(\omega) \\ &= \frac{i}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} d\omega\; \frac{e^{-i\omega t}}{\omega - (E_{\mathrm{res}}+i \mathrm{Im}[\Sigma])/\hbar}\\ &= \exp\left(-\frac{iE_{\mathrm{res}}t}{\hbar}\right)\, \exp\left(-\frac{|\mathrm{Im}[\Sigma]|}{\hbar}\,t\right). \end{aligned}
\end{align}
In deriving the last line, we performed a contour integration assuming
that $\mathrm{Im}[\Sigma] < 0$; this assumption will be proven
shortly.  The final result is
\begin{equation}
  P(t) = e^{-\kappa t}, \;\;\;\mathrm{where}\;\;\kappa = \frac{2|\mathrm{Im}[\Sigma]|}{\hbar}.
\end{equation}

Let us now take a closer look at the self-energy.  From our earlier
definition,
\begin{equation}
  \Sigma(E) \equiv \lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow0^+} \int d^dk\, \frac{\displaystyle| \langle\psi_k| \hat{V}_1|\varphi\rangle|^2}{\displaystyle E-E_k+i\varepsilon},
\end{equation}
where $|\varphi\rangle$ and $\{|\psi_k\rangle\}$ are the bound and
free states of the model in the absence of $\hat{V}_1$, and $E_k$ is
the energy of the $k$-th free state.  The imaginary part is
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned}\mathrm{Im}\big[\Sigma(E)\big] &= \lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow0^+} \int d^dk\, \Big| \langle\psi_k| \hat{V}_1|\varphi\rangle\Big|^2 \; \mathrm{Im}\left( \frac{1}{\displaystyle E-E_k+i\varepsilon}\right) \\ &= - \int d^dk\, \Big| \langle\psi_k| \hat{V}_1|\varphi\rangle\Big|^2 \; \left[ \lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow0^+} \; \frac{\varepsilon}{\displaystyle (E-E_k)^2 + \varepsilon^2}\right].\end{aligned}
\end{align}
The quantity inside the square brackets is a Lorentzian function,
which is always positive; hence, $\mathrm{Im}(\Sigma) < 0$, as
previously asserted.  The Lorentzian function has the limiting form
\begin{equation}
  \lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow 0^+} \frac{\varepsilon}{x^2+\varepsilon^2} = \pi\delta(x).
\end{equation}
This comes from the fact that as $\varepsilon\rightarrow0^+$, the
Lorentzian curve describes a sharper and sharper peak, but the area
under the curve is fixed as $\pi$.  Hence,
\begin{equation}
  \mathrm{Im}\big[\Sigma(E)\big] = - \pi \int d^dk\, \Big| \langle\psi_k| \hat{V}_1|\varphi\rangle\Big|^2 \; \delta(E-E_k).
\end{equation}
Because of the delta function, we see that the only non-vanishing
contributions to the integral come from the parts of $k$-space where
$E = E_k$.

We can further simplify the result by defining the \textbf{density of
  states},
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{D}(E) = \int d^d k\; \delta(E - E_k).
\end{equation}
Roughly speaking, this measures the number of free states that exist
at energy $E$.  The $k$-space volume $d^dk$ is proportional to the
number of free states at each $k$, while the delta function restricts
the contributions to only those free states with energy $E$.  (In
the next section, we'll see an explicit example of how to calculate
$\mathcal{D}(E)$.)  Now, for any function $f(k)$,
\begin{equation}
  \int d^d k\; f(k) \, \delta(E - E_k) = \overline{f(k(E))} \;\mathcal{D}(E),
\end{equation}
where $\overline{f(k(E))}$ denotes the mean value of $f(k)$ for the
free states satisfying $E_k = E$.  Applying this to the imaginary part
of the self-energy gives
\begin{equation}
  \mathrm{Im}\big[\Sigma(E)\big] = - \pi \; \overline{\Big| \langle\psi_{k(E)}| \hat{V}_1|\varphi\rangle\Big|^2} \; \mathcal{D}(E).
\end{equation}
Hence, the quasi-bound state's decay rate is
\begin{framed}
  \begin{equation}
    \kappa \,=\, -\frac{2}{\hbar}\mathrm{Im}\big[\Sigma(E_{\mathrm{res}})\big] \,=\, \frac{2\pi}{\hbar} \; \overline{\Big| \langle\psi_{k(E_{\mathrm{res}})}| \hat{V}_1|\varphi\rangle\Big|^2} \; \mathcal{D}(E_{\mathrm{res}}).
  \end{equation}
\end{framed}
\vskip -0.15in
This extremely important result is called \textbf{Fermi's golden
  rule}.  It says that the decay rate of a quasi-bound mode is
directly proportional to two factors.  The first factor describes how
strongly $\hat{V}_1$ couples the quasi-bound state and the free
states, as determined by the quantity $\langle\psi_{k}|
\hat{V}_1|\varphi\rangle$, called the \textbf{transition amplitude}.
It goes to zero when $\hat{V}_1 = 0$, which is the case where
$|\varphi\rangle$ is a true bound state that does not decay.  The
second factor is the density of free states, and describes how many
free states are available for $|\varphi\rangle$ to decay into.  Both
factors depend on energy, and must be evaluated at the resonance
energy $E_{\mathrm{res}}$.

\section{Fermi's golden rule in a 1D resonance model}

Fermi's golden rule can be used to study a wide variety of quantum
systems, and we will see examples of its usefulness in subsequent
chapters.  In this section, we will apply it to the simple 1D model
from Section~\ref{sec:resonances}, and evaluate how well it works.
The model potential is
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}&V(x) = V_0(x) + V_1(x), \;\;\;\mathrm{where} \\ &V_0(x) = -U \, \Theta(a-|x|), \;\; V_1(x) = V_b\, \Theta(b-|x|), \;\;\; 0<U<V_b.\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
The potential well $V_0$ supports one or more bound states.  For
simplicity, we focus on the ground state, whose energy $E_0$ lies in
the range $[-U,0]$.  Once $V_1$ is introduced, this will turn into the
lowest quasi-bound state, with resonance energy $E_{\mathrm{res}}
\approx E_0 + V_b > 0$.

When the potential consists only of $V_0$, the ground state
wavefunction can be obtained by solving the Schr\"odinger wave
equation for the boundary condition $\varphi(x) \rightarrow 0$ as
$|x|\rightarrow\infty$.  It has the form
\begin{equation}
  \varphi(x) = \begin{cases}\mathcal{A}\,\cos(qx), & |x| < a \\
    \mathcal{B} \, \exp\left(-\eta|x|\right), & |x| \ge a,\end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ are constants to be determined,
and
\begin{equation}
  q = \sqrt{\frac{2m}{\hbar^2}(E_0+U)}, \;\; \eta = \sqrt{\frac{2m}{\hbar^2}|E_0|}.
\end{equation}
By matching both $\varphi(x)$ and $d\varphi/dx$ across the $x=a$
interface, we can derive a transcendental equation for $E_0$, which
can be solved numerically.  Once we know $E_0$, we also know $q$ and
$\eta$.  We can then relate $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ by
matching $\varphi(x)$ across the $x=a$ interface:
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{A} = \mathcal{B}\; \frac{\exp(-\eta a)}{\cos(qa)}.
\end{equation}
Moreover, the wavefunction must be normalized to unity:
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned}1 &= \mathcal{A}^2 \int_{-a}^a \cos^2(qx) + 2\mathcal{B}^2 \int_a^\infty dx\; \exp(-2\eta x) \\ &= \mathcal{A}^2 \left(a+\frac{\sin(2qa)}{2q}\right) + \mathcal{B}^2\, \frac{\exp(-2\eta a)}{\eta}.\end{aligned}
\end{align}
Putting the last two equations together yields
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{B}^2 = \frac{\exp\big(2\eta a\big)}{a} \left[\frac{1+\sin(2qa)/2qa}{\cos^2(qa)}+\frac{1}{\eta a}\right]^{-1}.
\end{equation}
We now wish to compute the transition amplitude
\begin{equation}
  \langle\psi_k|\hat{V}_1|\varphi\rangle \,=\, \int_{-\infty}^\infty dx \, \psi_k^*(x)\, V_1(x)\, \varphi(x) \,=\, V_b \int_{-b}^b dx \; \psi_k^*(x) \,\varphi(x),
\end{equation}
where $\psi_k(x)$ is the wavefunction of a free state for the system
with potential $V_0(x)$, which is labelled by some continuous index
$k$.  We can use a trick to avoid calculating the exact form of
$\psi_k(x)$.  Because $\psi_k(x)$ and $\varphi(x)$ must be orthogonal,
\begin{equation}
  \int_{-b}^b dx \; \psi_k^*(x) \,\varphi(x) = - \int_{|x| > a} dx \; \psi_k^*(x) \,\varphi(x).
\end{equation}
When evaluating the free states outside the potential well, we can
approximate them as the free states of the particle without the
potential well, i.e., simple plane waves:
\begin{equation}
  \psi_k(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\, e^{ikx}, \;\;\;k\in\mathbb{R}, \;\;|x|>a.
\end{equation}
We likewise approximate their energies by $E_k \approx \hbar^2k^2/2m$.
Plugging $\psi_k(x)$ into the formula for the transition amplitude,
and performing the necessary integrals, yields
\begin{equation}
  \langle\psi_k|\hat{V}_1|\varphi\rangle \,=\, - \mathcal{B} \, \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} \, \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \; \big[\eta\cos(kb) - k\sin(kb)\big] \, \exp(-\eta b).
\end{equation}
Within Fermi's golden rule, we must use a value of $k$ such that
\begin{equation}
  E_k = E_{\mathrm{res}} \approx E_0 + V_b \;\;\;\Rightarrow \;\;\; k \approx \sqrt{\frac{2m}{\hbar^2}(E_0+V_b)}.
\end{equation}

The next thing that we need to calculate is the density of free
states.  This can be done by once again taking $E_k \approx
\hbar^2k^2/2m$, and performing a change of variables:
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned}\mathcal{D}(E) &= \int_{-\infty}^\infty dk \; \delta\left(E-\frac{\hbar^2k^2}{2m}\right) \\ &= 2 \cdot \int_0^\infty dE' \, \frac{dk}{dE'} \, \delta(E-E') \\ &= \sqrt{\frac{2m}{\hbar^2 E}}.
  \end{aligned}
\end{align}
Note the factor of 2 on the second line; it is there because there is
both a positive and a negative value of $k$ for each $E$.

Having obtained expressions for the transition amplitude and the
density of states, we just have to plug them into Fermi's golden rule
to obtain the decay rate $\kappa$.  The figure below shows how
$\kappa$ varies with the barrier thickness $b-a$, with all other model
parameters fixed ($U = 20, V_b = 30, a = 1$):

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{goldenrule}
\end{figure}

For comparison, the figure also plots the width of the resonant
scattering peak, which according to our preceding discussion is
supposed to be equal to $\kappa$.  To obtain these values, we use the
transfer matrix method to compute the $E$-dependent transmittance for
particles incident on one side of the potential (see Appendix B).  The
transmittance is peaked near $E_{\mathrm{res}}$, and the full-width at
half-maximum (see Section~\ref{sec:green_resonances}) is estimated
numerically.  The results are shown as blue dots in the figure.

We see that Fermi's golden rule generally agrees well with the results
from the transfer matrix method.  There is some discrepancy, notably
when the barrier is thin.  Remember that Fermi's golden rule relies on
the approximation that the quasi-bound state is strongly confined
(i.e., having $\langle \varphi|G|\varphi\rangle$ be large in the
derivations of Sections~\ref{sec:green_resonances} and
\ref{sec:goldenrule}).  Moreover, we have approximated the free states
$|\psi_k\rangle$ using the plane wave states in the absence of any
potential, which is an assumption commonly employed when using Fermi's
golden rule.



\section*{Exercises}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Use the variational theorem to prove that a 1D potential well
  has at least one bound state.  Assume that the potential $V(x)$
  satisfies (i) $V(x) < 0$ for all $x$, and (ii) $V(x)\rightarrow 0$
  for $x\rightarrow\pm\infty$.  The Hamiltonian is
  \begin{equation}
    \hat{H} = - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{d^2}{dx^2} + V(x).
  \end{equation}
  Consider a (real) trial wavefunction
  \begin{equation}
    \psi(x;\gamma) = \left(\frac{2\gamma}{\pi}\right)^{1/4} \,e^{-\gamma x^2}.
  \end{equation}
  Note that this can be shown to be normalized to unity, using Gauss'
  integral
  \begin{equation}
    \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} dx\; e^{-2\gamma x^2} = \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2\gamma}}.
  \end{equation}
  Now prove that
  \begin{align}
    \begin{aligned}
      \langle E \rangle &= \int_{-\infty}^\infty dx \; \psi(x) \, \hat{H} \,\psi(x) \\
      &= \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \int_{-\infty}^\infty dx\, \left(\frac{d\psi}{dx}\right)^2
      \;+\; \int_{-\infty}^\infty dx\; V(x) \,\psi^2(x) \\
      &= A\sqrt{\gamma} \left[\sqrt{\gamma}
        \;+\, B \int_{-\infty}^\infty dx\; V(x) \;e^{-\gamma x^2}
        \right],
    \end{aligned}
  \end{align}
  where $A$ and $B$ are positive real constants to be determined.  By
  looking at the quantity in square brackets in the limit $\gamma
  \rightarrow 0$, argue that $\langle E \rangle < 0$ in this limit.
  Hence, explain why this implies the existence of a bound state.

  Finally, try generalizing this approach to the case of a 2D
  radially-symmetric potential well $V(x,y) = V(r)$, where $r =
  \sqrt{x^2+y^2}$.  Identify which part of the argument fails in 2D.
       [For a discussion of certain 2D potential wells that
         \textit{do} always support bounds states, similar to 1D
         potential wells, see Ref.~[\ref{cite:simon}].]
  \label{ex:boundstate}

\item In this problem, you will investigate the existence of bound
  states in a 3D potential well that is finite, uniform, and
  spherically-symmetric.  The potential function is
  \begin{equation}
    V(r,\theta,\phi) = -U\Theta(a-r),
  \end{equation}
  where $a$ is the radius of the spherical well, $U$ is the depth,
  and $(r,\theta,\phi)$ are spherical coordinates defined in the usual
  way.

  The solution involves a variant of the partial wave analysis
  discussed in Appendix A.  For $E < 0$, the Schr\"odinger equation
  reduces to
  \begin{equation}
    \begin{cases}\Big(\nabla^2 + q^2\Big) \psi(r,\theta,\phi) = 0 \;\;\mathrm{where}\;\; q = \sqrt{2m(E+U)/\hbar^2}, \;\;&\mathrm{for} \; r \le a \\ \Big(\nabla^2 - \gamma^2\Big) \psi(r,\theta,\phi) = 0 \;\;\mathrm{where}\;\; \gamma = \sqrt{-2mE/\hbar^2}, \;\;&\mathrm{for} \; r \ge a. \end{cases}
  \end{equation}
  For the first equation (called the Helmholtz equation), we seek
  solutions of the form
  \begin{equation}
    \psi(r,\theta,\phi) = f(r) \, Y_{\ell m}(\theta,\phi),
  \end{equation}
  where $Y_{\ell m}(\theta,\phi)$ are
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_harmonics}{spherical
    harmonics}, and the integers $l$ and $m$ are angular momentum
  quantum numbers satisfying $l \ge 0$ and $-l \le m \le l$.
  Substituting into the Helmholtz equation yields
  \begin{equation}
    r^2\frac{d^2f}{dr^2} + 2r \frac{df}{dr}+\left[q^2r^2-l(l+1)\right] f(r) = 0,
  \end{equation}
  which is the \textbf{spherical Bessel equation}.  The solutions to
  this equation that are non-divergent at $r = 0$ are $f(r) =
  j_\ell(qr)$, where $j_\ell$ is called a \textbf{spherical Bessel function
    of the first kind}.  Most numerical packages provide functions to
  calculate these (e.g.,
  \href{https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.special.spherical_jn.html}{\texttt{scipy.special.spherical\_jn}}
  in \href{https://scipy.org/}{Scientific Python}).

  Similarly, solutions for the second equation can be written as
  $\psi(r,\theta,\phi) = g(r) \, Y_{\ell m}(\theta,\phi),$ yielding an
  equation for $g(r)$ called the \textbf{modified spherical Bessel
    equation}.  The solutions which do not diverge as $r\rightarrow
  \infty$ are $g(r) = k_\ell(\gamma r)$, where $k_\ell$ is called a
  \textbf{modified spherical Bessel function of the second kind}.
  Again, this can be computed numerically (e.g., using
  \href{https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.special.spherical_kn.html#scipy.special.spherical_kn}{\texttt{scipy.special.spherical\_kn}}
  in Scientific Python).

  Using the above facts, show that the condition for a bound state to
  exist is
  \begin{equation}
    \frac{qj_\ell'(qa)}{j_\ell(qa)} = \frac{\gamma k_\ell'(\gamma a)}{k_\ell(\gamma a)},
  \end{equation}
  where $j_\ell'$ and $k_\ell'$ denote the derivatives of the relevant
  special functions, and $q$ and $\gamma$ depend on $E$ and $U$ as
  described above.  Write a program to search for the bound state
  energies at any given $a$ and $U$, and hence determine the
  conditions under which the potential does not support bound
  states.
