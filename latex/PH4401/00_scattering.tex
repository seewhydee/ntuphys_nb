%% \section{Scattering Processes in Quantum Mechanics}

\section{Scattering experiments on quantum particles}

Quantum particles exhibit a feature known as \textbf{wave-particle
  duality}, which can be summarized in the \textbf{quantum double-slit
  thought experiment}.  As shown in the figure below, a source emits
electrons with energy $E$, which travel towards a screen with a pair
of slits.  A detector is positioned on the other side of the screen.
By moving the detector around, we can measure the rate at which
electrons are detected at different positions.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{doubleslit}
\end{figure}

According to quantum theory, the experiment reveals the following: (i)
the electrons arrive in discrete units---one at a time, like classical
particles; (ii) when we move the detector around to measure how the
detection events are \textit{statistically} distributed in space, the
resulting distribution matches an interference pattern formed by a
classical wave diffracted by the slits.  The wavelength $\lambda$ is
related to the electron energy $E$ by
\begin{equation}
  \lambda = \frac{2\pi}{k}, \;\;\; E = \frac{\hbar^2k^2}{2m},
\end{equation}
where $\hbar = h/2\pi$ is Dirac's constant, and $m$ is the electron
mass.  (This also implies that we can deduce the spacing of the slits
from the diffraction pattern, if $E$ is known.)

Wave-particle duality arises from quantum theory's distinction between
a particle's state and the outcomes of measurements performed on it.
The state is described by a wavefunction $\psi(\mathbf{r})$, which can
undergo diffraction like a classical wave.  Measurement outcomes,
however, depend \textit{probabilistically} on the wavefunction.  In a
position measurement, the probability of locating a particle in a
volume $dV$ around position $\mathbf{r}$ is $|\psi(\mathbf{r})|^2
\,dV$.

In this chapter, we will study a generalization of the double-slit
experiment called a \textbf{scattering experiment}.  The idea is to
take an object called a \textbf{scatterer}, shoot quantum particles at
it, and measure the resulting particle distribution.  Just as the
double-slit interference pattern can be used to deduce the slit
spacing, a scattering experiment can be used to deduce various facts
about the scatterer.  Scattering experiments constitute a large
proportion of the methods used to probe the quantum world---from
electron- and photon-based laboratory experiments for measuring the
properties of materials, to huge accelerator experiments that study
high-energy phenomena like the Higgs boson.

We will focus on a simple scenario with a single non-relativistic
quantum particle and a classical scatterer.  Consider a continuous and
unbounded $d$-dimensional space, describable by coordinates
$\mathbf{r}$.  Somewhere around the origin, $\mathbf{r} = 0$, is a
finite-sized scatterer.  An incoming quantum particle, with energy
$E$, is governed by the Hamiltonian
\begin{equation}
  \hat{H} = \hat{H}_0 + V(\hat{\mathbf{r}}), \;\;\; \hat{H}_0 = \frac{\hat{\mathbf{p}}^2}{2m}.
\end{equation}
Here, $\hat{H}_0$ describes the particle's kinetic energy, $m$ is the
particle's mass, $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ and $\hat{\mathbf{p}}$ are
position and momentum operators, and $V$ is a \textbf{scattering
  potential} describing how the scatterer affects the quantum
particle.  We assume that $V(\mathbf{r}) \rightarrow 0$ as
$|\mathbf{r}| \rightarrow \infty$, i.e., the scattering potential
becomes negligible far from the origin.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{scattering}
\end{figure}

We prepare an incoming particle state with energy $E$, and want to see
how the particle is scattered by the potential.  However, converting
these words into a well-defined mathematical problem is a bit tricky!
We will give the formulation first, before discussing its meaning:
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
The particle state $|\psi\rangle$ obeys the time-independent
Schr\"odinger equation
\begin{equation}
  \hat{H} |\psi\rangle = E |\psi\rangle,
\end{equation}
where $E$ is the incoming particle energy.

\item
This state can be decomposed into two terms,
\begin{equation}
  |\psi\rangle \,=\, |\psi_i\rangle \,+\, |\psi_s\rangle,
\end{equation}
where $|\psi_i\rangle$ is called the \textbf{incident state} and
$|\psi_s\rangle$ is called the \textbf{scattered state}.

\item
The incident state is a plane wave eigenstate of $\hat{H}_0$ with
energy $E$:
\begin{equation}
  \hat{H}_0 |\psi_i\rangle = E |\psi_i\rangle.
\end{equation}

\item
We require the scattered state to be an ``outgoing'' state.  This is
the most subtle of the conditions, and we will describe what it means
later.
\end{enumerate}
The first condition says that the scattering process is elastic.
Since the scatterer takes the form of a potential $V(\mathbf{r})$, its
interaction with the particle is conservative (i.e., the total energy
$E$ is fixed).  The second condition, viewed in the position basis,
says that the particle's wavefunction $\psi(\mathbf{r}) = \langle
\mathbf{r} |\psi\rangle$ can be taken as a superposition of an
incoming wave and a scattered wave.  The third condition says that the
incoming wave is a plane wave with wavelength corresponding to the
energy $E$.  The final condition says that the scattered wave must be
a wave that moves out toward infinity.

Given $|\psi_i\rangle$, $E$, and $V(\mathbf{r})$, we must solve for
$|\psi_s\rangle$.  Note that \textit{this is not an eigenproblem}!
Usually, when dealing with the time-independent Schr\"odinger
equation, we treat it as an eigenproblem and solve for the energy
eigenvalues and eigenstates.  But here $E$ is an input to the
calculation, not an output---it describes the energy that we give to
the incoming quantum particles.

\section{Recap: position and momentum states}

Before proceeding, let us review the properties of quantum particles
in free space.  In a $d$-dimensional space, a coordinate vector
$\mathbf{r}$ is a real vector of $d$ components.  A quantum particle
can be described by the position basis---a set of quantum states
$\{|\mathbf{r}\rangle\}$, one for each possible $\mathbf{r}$.  The
$\mathbf{r}$'s form a continuum, so this set of quantum states is
uncountably infinite.  If we are studying a particle trapped in a
finite region (e.g., a particle in a box), $\mathbf{r}$ is restricted
to that region; otherwise, $\mathbf{r}$ is any real $d$-dimensional
vector.

In either case, $\{|\mathbf{r}\rangle\}$ spans the state space, so the
identity operator can be resolved as
\begin{equation}
  \hat{I} = \int d^dr \, |\mathbf{r}\rangle \,\langle\mathbf{r}|,
\end{equation}
where the integral is taken over all allowed $\mathbf{r}$.  It
follows that
\begin{equation}
  \langle \mathbf{r} | \mathbf{r}' \rangle = \delta^d(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}').
\end{equation}
The position eigenstates are thus said to be ``delta-function
normalized'', rather than being normalized to unity.  In the above
equation, $\delta^d(\cdots)$ denotes the $d$-dimensional delta
function; for example, in 2D,
\begin{equation*}
  \langle x,y \,|\, x',y' \rangle = \delta(x-x') \, \delta(y-y').
\end{equation*}

The position operator $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ is defined by taking
$|\mathbf{r}\rangle$ and $\mathbf{r}$ as its eigenstates and
eigenvalues:
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\mathbf{r}} |\mathbf{r}\rangle \,=\, \mathbf{r}\, |\mathbf{r}\rangle.
\end{equation}

Momentum eigenstates are constructed from position eigenstates via
Fourier transforms.  First, suppose the allowed region of space is a
box of length $L$ on each side, with periodic boundary conditions in
every direction.  Define the set of wave-vectors $\mathbf{k}$
corresponding to plane waves satisfying the periodic boundary
conditions at the box boundaries:
\begin{equation*}
  \Big\{\mathbf{k}  \; \Big| \;\; k_j = 2\pi m/L\;\;\mathrm{for}
  \;m\in\mathbb{Z}, \; j = 1, \dots,d\, \Big\}.
\end{equation*}
So long as $L$ is finite, the $\mathbf{k}$ vectors are discrete.
Now define
\begin{equation}
  |\mathbf{k}\rangle = \frac{1}{L^{d/2}} \, \int d^dr \; e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}} |\mathbf{r}\rangle,
\end{equation}
where the integral is taken over the box.  These can be shown to
satisfy
\begin{equation}
  \langle\mathbf{k}|\mathbf{k}'\rangle = \delta_{\mathbf{k},\mathbf{k}'}, \quad \langle\mathbf{r}|\mathbf{k}'\rangle = \frac{1}{L^{d/2}} e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}}, \quad I = \sum_{\mathbf{k}} |\mathbf{k}\rangle\,\langle\mathbf{k}|.
\end{equation}
The momentum operator is defined so that its eigenstates are
$\{|\mathbf{k}\rangle\}$, with $\hbar\mathbf{k}$ as the corresponding
eigenvalues:
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\mathbf{p}} |\mathbf{k}\rangle \,=\, \hbar \mathbf{k}\, |\mathbf{k}\rangle.
\end{equation}
Thus, for finite $L$, the momentum eigenstates are discrete and
normalizable to unity.  The momentum component in each direction is
quantized to a multiple of $\Delta p = 2\pi\hbar/L$.

We then take the limit of an infinite box, $L \rightarrow \infty$.  In
this limit, $\Delta p \rightarrow 0$, so the momentum eigenvalues
coalesce into a continuum.  It is convenient to re-normalize the
momentum eigenstates by taking
\begin{equation}
  |\mathbf{k}\rangle \rightarrow \left(\frac{L}{2\pi}\right)^{d/2} |\mathbf{k}\rangle.
\end{equation}
In the $L\rightarrow\infty$ limit, the re-normalized momentum
eigenstates satisfy
\begin{framed}
  \begin{align}
      |\mathbf{k}\rangle &= \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{d/2}} \, \int d^dr \; e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}} |\mathbf{r}\rangle, \\
      |\mathbf{r}\rangle &= \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{d/2}} \, \int d^dk \; e^{-i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}} |\mathbf{k}\rangle, \\
      \langle\mathbf{k}|\mathbf{k}'\rangle = \delta^d(\mathbf{k}-\mathbf{k}'),& \quad \langle\mathbf{r}|\mathbf{k}\rangle = \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{d/2}} e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}}, \quad I = \int d^dk \;|\mathbf{k}\rangle\,\langle\mathbf{k}|.
  \end{align}
\end{framed}
\vskip -0.15in
\noindent
The above integrals are taken over infinite space, and the position
and momentum eigenstates are now on a similar footing: both are
delta-function normalized.  In deriving the above equations, it is
helpful to use the formula
\begin{equation}
  \int_{-\infty}^\infty dx\; \exp(ikx) \;=\; 2\pi\, \delta(k).
\end{equation}

For an arbitrary quantum state $|\psi\rangle$, a wavefunction is
defined as the projection onto the position basis: $\psi(\mathbf{r}) =
\langle \mathbf{r}|\psi\rangle$.  Using the momentum eigenstates, we can
show that
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned}\langle \mathbf{r}|\hat{\mathbf{p}}|\psi\rangle &=  \int d^dk \; \langle\mathbf{r}|\mathbf{k}\rangle \; \hbar\mathbf{k} \; \langle\mathbf{k}|\psi\rangle \\ &=  \int \frac{d^dk}{(2\pi)^{d/2}}\; \hbar\mathbf{k} \;e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}} \langle\mathbf{k}|\psi\rangle \\ &=  -i\hbar\nabla \int \frac{d^dk}{(2\pi)^{d/2}}\; \;e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}} \langle\mathbf{k}|\psi\rangle \\ &= -i\hbar \nabla\psi(\mathbf{r}).\end{aligned}
\end{align}
This result can also be used to prove Heisenberg's commutation relation
$[\hat{r}_i, \hat{p}_j] = i\hbar\delta_{ij}$.

\section{Scattering from a 1D delta-function potential}
\label{sec:1dscatter}

We are now ready to solve a simple scattering problem.  Consider a 1D
space with spatial coordinate denoted by $x$, and a scattering
potential that consists of a ``spike'' at $x = 0$:
\begin{equation}
  V(x) = \frac{\hbar^2\gamma}{2m} \,\delta(x).
\end{equation}
The form of the prefactor $\hbar^2\gamma/2m$ is chosen for later
convenience; the parameter $\gamma$, which has units of $[1/x]$,
controls the strength of the scattering potential.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{scattering1d}
\end{figure}

If you are disturbed by the idea of a delta function potential, just
regard it as the limiting case of a family of increasingly tall and
narrow gaussian functions centered at $x=0$.  For each non-singular
potential, the applicability of the Schr\"odinger wave equation
implies that the wavefunction $\psi(x)$ is continuous and has
well-defined first and second derivatives.  In the delta function
limit, however, these conditions are relaxed: $\psi(x)$ remains
continuous, but at $x=0$ the first derivative becomes discontinuous
and the second derivative blows up.  To see this, we integrate the
Schr\"odinger wave equation over an infinitesimal range around $x =
0$:
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned}\lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow 0^+} \int_{-\varepsilon}^{+\varepsilon} dx\; \left[-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{d^2}{dx^2} + \frac{\hbar^2\gamma}{2m} \delta(x)\right] \psi(x) &= \lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow 0^+} \int_{-\varepsilon}^{+\varepsilon} dx\; E \psi(x) \\ = \lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow 0^+} \left\{-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \left[\frac{d\psi}{dx}\right]_{-\varepsilon}^{+\varepsilon} \right\} + \frac{\hbar^2\gamma}{2m} \psi(0) &= 0
  \end{aligned}
\end{align}
Hence, we find that wavefunction's first derivative has the following
discontinuity:
\begin{equation}
  \lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow 0^+} \left\{\; \left.\frac{d\psi}{dx}\right|_{x = +\varepsilon} - \left.\frac{d\psi}{dx}\right|_{x = -\varepsilon}\; \right\} =  \gamma \,\psi(0).
  \label{delta_discontinuity}
\end{equation}

To proceed, consider a particle incident from the left, with energy
$E$.  This is described by an incident state proportional to a
momentum eigenstate $|k\rangle$, where $k = \sqrt{2mE/\hbar^2} > 0$.
We said ``proportional'', not ``equal'', for it is conventional to
adopt the normalization
\begin{equation}
  |\psi_i\rangle = \sqrt{2\pi}\Psi_i |k\rangle \;\;\; \Leftrightarrow\;\;\; \psi_i(x) = \langle x|\psi\rangle = \Psi_i \, e^{ik x}.
\end{equation}
The complex constant $\Psi_i$ is called the ``incident amplitude.''
Plugging this into the Schr\"odinger wave equation gives
\begin{equation}
  \left[-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{d^2}{dx^2} + \frac{\hbar^2\gamma}{2m}\delta(x)\right] \left(\Psi_i \, e^{ikx} + \psi_s(x) \right) = E \left(\Psi_i \, e^{ikx} + \psi_s(x) \right).
\end{equation}
Taking $E = \hbar^2k^2/2m$, and doing a bit of algebra, simplifies this to
\begin{equation}
  \left[ \frac{d^2}{dx^2} + k^2\right] \psi_s(x) =  \gamma \delta(x) \left(\Psi_i \, e^{ikx} + \psi_s(x) \right),
\end{equation}
which is an inhomogenous ordinary differential equation for
$\psi_s(x)$, with the potential on the right hand side acting as a
``driving term''.

To find the solution, consider the two regions $x < 0$ and $x > 0$.
Since $\delta(x) \rightarrow 0$ for $x \ne 0$, the equation in each
half-space reduces to
\begin{equation}
  \left[\frac{d^2}{dx^2} + k^2\right] \psi_s(x) = 0.
\end{equation}
This is the \textbf{Helmholtz equation}, whose general solution may be
written as
\begin{equation}
  \psi_s(x) = \Psi_i \left(f_1 \, e^{ik x} + f_2 \, e^{-ik x}\right).
\end{equation}
Here, $f_1$ and $f_2$ are complex numbers that can take on different
values in the two different regions $x < 0$ and $x > 0$.

We want $\psi_s(x)$ to describe an \textbf{outgoing wave}, moving away
from the scatterer towards infinity.  So it should be purely
left-moving for $x < 0$, and purely right-moving for $x > 0$.  To
achieve this, let $f_1 = 0$ for $x < 0$, and $f_2 = 0$ for $x > 0$, so
that $\psi_s(x)$ has the form
\begin{equation}
  \psi_s(x) = \Psi_i \times \begin{cases}f_- \,e^{-ikx}, & x < 0 \\ f_+ \,e^{ikx}, & x > 0.\end{cases}
\end{equation}
The complex numbers $f_-$ and $f_+$ are called \textbf{scattering
  amplitudes}.  They describe the magnitude and phase of the
wavefunction scattered backwards into the $x<0$ region, and scattered
forward into the $x > 0$ region, respectively.

Recall from the discussion at the beginning of this section that
$\psi(x)$ must be continuous everywhere, including at $x = 0$.  Since
$\psi_i(x)$ is continuous, $\psi_s(x)$ must be as well, so $f_- =
f_+$.  Moreover, we showed in Eq.~\eqref{delta_discontinuity} that the
first derivative of $\psi(x)$ is discontinuous at the scatterer.
Plugging \eqref{delta_discontinuity} into our expression for
$\psi(x)$, at $x = 0$, gives
\begin{equation}
  \Psi_i\big[ik(1+f_\pm) - ik(1-f_\pm)\big] =  \Psi(1+f_\pm) \gamma.
\end{equation}
Hence, we obtain
\begin{equation}
  f_+ = f_- = -\frac{\gamma}{\gamma - 2ik}.
\end{equation}

For now, let us focus on the magnitude of the scattering amplitude (in
the next chapter, we will see that the phase also contains useful
information).  The quantity $|f_\pm|^2$ describes the overall strength
of the scattering process:
\begin{equation}
  |f_\pm|^2 = \left[1 + \frac{8mE}{(\hbar\gamma)^2}\right]^{-1}.
\end{equation}
Its dependence on $E$ is plotted below:

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.55\textwidth]{scattering1df}
\end{figure}

\noindent
There are several notable features in this plot.  First, for fixed
potential strength $\gamma$, the scattering strength decreases
monotonically with $E$---i.e., higher-energy particles are scattered
less easily.  Second, for given $E$, the scattering strength increases
with $|\gamma|$, with the limit $|f|^2 \rightarrow 1$ as
$|\gamma|\rightarrow \infty$.  Third, an attractive potential ($\gamma
< 0$) and a repulsive potential ($\gamma > 0$) are equally effective
at scattering the particle.

\section{Scattering in 2D and 3D}
\label{sec:2d3d_scattering}

We now wish to consider scattering experiments in spatial dimension $d
\ge 2$, which have a new and important feature.  For $d = 1$, the
particle can only scatter forward or backward, but for $d \ge 2$ it
can be scattered to the side.

Far from the scatterer, where $V(\mathbf{r})\rightarrow 0$, the
scattered wavefunction $\psi_s(\mathbf{r})$ satisfies
\begin{equation}
  -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 \psi_s(\mathbf{r}) = E \psi_s(\mathbf{r}),
\end{equation}
where $\nabla^2$ denotes the $d$-dimensional Laplacian.  Let $E =
\hbar^2 k^2 / 2m$, where $k \in \mathbf{R}^+$ is the wave-number in
free space.  Then the above equation can be written as
\begin{equation}
  \left[\nabla^2 + k^2\right] \psi_s(\mathbf{r}) = 0,
\end{equation}
which is the \textbf{Helmholtz equation} in $d$-dimensional space.

One set of elementary solutions to the Helmholtz equation are the
plane waves
\begin{equation*}
  \big\{\exp(i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}),\;\;\mathrm{where}\;\;
  |\mathbf{k}| = k \big\}.
\end{equation*}
But we're looking for an outgoing solution, and a plane wave can't be
said to be ``outgoing''.

Therefore, we turn to curvilinear coordinates.  In 2D, we use the
polar coordinates $(r,\phi)$.  We will skip the mathematical details
of how to solve the 2D Helmholtz equation in these coordinates; the
result is that the general solution can be written as a linear
combination
\begin{equation}
  \psi(\mathbf{r})=\sum_{\pm}\sum_{m=-\infty}^\infty c_m^\pm\,\Psi_m^\pm(r,\phi), \;\;\;\mathrm{where}\;\;\,\Psi_m^\pm(r,\phi) = H_m^\pm(kr)\,e^{im\phi}.
\end{equation}
This is a superposition of circular waves $\Psi_m^\pm(r,\phi)$, with
coefficients $c_m^\pm \in \mathbb{C}$.  Each circular wave is a
solution to the 2D Helmholtz equation with angular momentum quantum
number $m \in \mathbb{Z}$.  Its $r$-dependence is given by $H_m^\pm$,
called a \textbf{Hankel function} of the ``first kind'' ($+$) or
``second kind'' ($-$).  Some Hankel functions of the first kind are
plotted below:

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{besselh}
\end{figure}

The $H^-_m$ functions are the complex conjugates of $H^+_m$.  For
large values of the input,
\begin{equation}
  H_m^\pm(kr) \overset{r\rightarrow\infty}{\longrightarrow} \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi kr}} \, \exp\left[\pm i\left(kr - \frac{(m+\frac{1}{2})\pi}{2}\right)\right] \;\sim\; r^{-1/2} e^{\pm ikr}.
\end{equation}
Therefore, the $\pm$ index specifies whether the circular wave is an
\textbf{outgoing wave} directed outward from the origin ($+$), or an
\textbf{incoming wave} directed toward the origin ($-$).

The 3D case is treated similarly.  We use spherical coordinates
$(r,\theta,\phi)$, and the solutions of the 3D Helmholtz equation are
superpositions of incoming and outgoing spherical waves:
\begin{equation}
  \psi(\mathbf{r})=\sum_{\pm}\sum_{\ell=0}^\infty\sum_{m=-\ell}^\ell c_{\ell m}^\pm \,\Psi_{\ell m}^\pm(r,\theta,\phi)\;\;\;\mathrm{where}\;\;\Psi_{\ell m}^\pm(r,\theta,\phi) = \,h_\ell^\pm(kr)\,Y_{\ell m}(\theta,\phi).
\end{equation}
The $c_{\ell m}^\pm$ factors are complex coefficients.  Each
$h_\ell^\pm$ is a \textbf{spherical Hankel function}, and each
$Y_{\ell m}$ is a \textbf{spherical harmonic}.  The $\ell$ and $m$
indices specify the angular momentum of the spherical wave.  For large
inputs, the spherical Hankel functions have the limiting form
\begin{equation}
  h_\ell^\pm(kr) \overset{r\rightarrow\infty}{\longrightarrow} \pm \frac{\exp\!\left[\pm i\!\left(kr-\frac{\ell\pi}{2}\right)\right]}{ikr}.
\end{equation}
Hence, the $\pm$ index specifies whether the spherical wave is
outgoing ($+$) or incoming ($-$).  More discussion about these
spherical waves can be found in Appendix A.

It is now clear what we need to do to get a scattered wavefunction
$\psi_s(\mathbf{r})$ that is outgoing at infinity.  We take a
superposition with only outgoing ($+$) wave components:
\begin{equation}
  \psi_s(\mathbf{r}) = \begin{cases} \displaystyle\sum_{m} c_m^+\,H_m^+(kr)\,e^{im\phi}, &d=2\\ \displaystyle\sum_{\ell m} c_{\ell m}^+\,h_\ell^+(kr)\,Y_{\ell m}(\theta,\phi),&d=3.\end{cases}
\end{equation}
For large $r$, the outgoing wavefunction has the $r$-dependence
\begin{equation}
  \psi_s(\mathbf{r}) \; \overset{r\rightarrow\infty}{\sim} \; r^{\frac{1-d}{2}} \,\exp\left(ikr\right).
\end{equation}

For $d > 1$, the magnitude of the wavefunction decreases with distance
from the origin.  This is as expected, because with increasing $r$
each outgoing wave spreads out over a wider area.  The probability
current density is $\mathbf{J} = (\hbar/m)
\mathrm{Im}\left[\psi_s^*\nabla\psi_s\right]$, and its $r$-component
is
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}J_r \; &\overset{r\rightarrow\infty}{\sim} \; \mathrm{Im}\left[r^{\frac{1-d}{2}} e^{-ikr} \frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(r^{\frac{1-d}{2}} e^{ikr}\right)\right] \\ &\;\;=\;\;\;\mathrm{Im}\left[\frac{1-d}{2}\, r^{-d} + ik r^{1-d}\right]\\ &\;\;=\;\;\; k \,r^{1-d}.\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
In $d$ dimensions, the area of a wave-front scales as $r^{d-1}$, so
the probability flux goes as $J_r \,r^{d-1} \sim k$, which is positive
and independent of $r$.  This describes a constant probability flux
flowing outward from the origin.  Note that if we plug $d=1$ into the
above formula, we find that $J_r$ scales as $r^0$ (i.e., a constant),
consistent with the results of the previous section: waves in 1D do
not spread out with distance as there is no transverse dimension.

\section{The scattering amplitude and scattering cross section}
\label{sec:scattering_amplitude}

We can use the results of the previous section to systematically
characterize the outcomes of a scattering experiment.  Let the
incident wavefunction be a plane wave,
\begin{equation}
  \psi_i(\mathbf{r}) = \Psi_i \, e^{i\mathbf{k}_i\cdot\mathbf{r}},
\end{equation}
in $d$-dimensional space.  Here, $\Psi_i \in \mathbb{C}$ is the
\textbf{incident wave amplitude}, and $\mathbf{k}_i$ is the incident
momentum.  Let $k = |\mathbf{k}_i|$ denote its magnitude, so that the
particle energy is $E = \hbar^2k^2/2m$.  We adopt coordinates
$(r,\Omega)$, where $r$ is the distance from the origin.  For 1D,
$\Omega \in \pm$ which specifies the choice of ``forward'' or
``backward'' scattering; for 2D polar coordinates, $\Omega = \phi$;
and for 3D spherical coordinates, $\Omega = (\theta,\phi)$.

Far from the origin, the scattered wavefunction reduces to the form
\begin{equation}
  \psi_s(\mathbf{r})\;  \overset{r\rightarrow\infty}{\longrightarrow}\; \Psi_i \, r^{\frac{1-d}{2}} \, e^{ikr} \, f(\Omega).
\end{equation}
The complex function $f(\Omega)$, called the \textbf{scattering
  amplitude}, is the fundamental quantity of interest in scattering
experiments.  It describes how the particle is scattered in various
directions, depending on the inputs to the problem (i.e.,
$\mathbf{k}_i$ and the scattering potential).

Sometimes, we write the scattering amplitude using the alternative
notation
\begin{equation}
  f(\mathbf{k}_i \rightarrow \mathbf{k}_f), \;\;\;\mathrm{where}\;\; \mathbf{k}_f = k \hat{\mathbf{r}}.
\end{equation}
This emphasizes firstly that the incident wave-vector is
$\mathbf{k}_i$; and secondly that the particle is scattered in some
direction which can be specified by either the unit position vector
$\hat{\mathbf{r}}$, or equivalently by the momentum vector
$\mathbf{k}_f = k \hat{\mathbf{r}}$, or by the angular coordinates
$\Omega$.

From the scattering amplitude, we define two other important
quantities of interest:
\begin{framed}
  \begin{align}
    \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} &= \big|f(\Omega)\big|^2 \qquad\quad\quad \text{(the \textbf{differential scattering cross section})} \\ \sigma &= \int d\Omega\; \big|f(\Omega)\big|^2 \quad\; \text{(the \textbf{total scattering cross section}).}
  \end{align}
\end{framed}
\vskip -0.15in
\noindent
In the second equation, $\int d\Omega$ denotes the integral(s) over
all the angle coordinates; for 1D, this is instead a discrete sum over
the two possible directions, forward and backward.

The term ``cross section'' comes from an analogy with the scattering
of classical particles.  Consider the probablity current density
associated with the scattered wavefunction:
\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{J}_s = \frac{\hbar}{m} \mathrm{Im}\big[\psi_s^*\nabla\psi_s\big].
\end{equation}
Let us focus only on the $r$-component of the current density, in the
$r\rightarrow\infty$ limit:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}J_{s,r}\; &\;\;=\;\;\;\, \frac{\hbar}{m}\, \mathrm{Im}\left[\psi_s^* \frac{\partial}{\partial r}\psi_s\right] \\ &\overset{r\rightarrow\infty}{\longrightarrow}\;\, \frac{\hbar}{m}\; |\Psi_i|^2 \; |f(\Omega)|^2 \mathrm{Im}\left[\left(r^{\frac{1-d}{2}} \, e^{ikr}\right)^* \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left(r^{\frac{1-d}{2}} \, e^{ikr}\right)\right] \\ & \;\;=\;\;\;\, \frac{\hbar \,k}{m}\; |\Psi_i|^2 \; |f(\Omega)|^2 \,r^{1-d}.\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
The total flux of outgoing probability is obtained by integrating
$J_{s,r}$ over a constant-$r$ surface:
\begin{equation}
  I_s \;=\; \int d\Omega\; r^{d-1} \, J_{s,r} \;=\; \frac{\hbar k}{m} \;|\Psi_i|^2 \; \int d\Omega\; \big|f(\Omega)\big|^2.
  \label{scatterI}
\end{equation}
We can assign a physical interpretation to each term in this
result.  The first factor, $\hbar k/m$, is the
particle's speed (i.e., the group velocity of the de Broglie wave).
The second factor, $|\Psi_i|^2$, is the probability density of the incident
wave, which has units of $[x^{-d}]$ (i.e., inverse $d$-dimensional
``volume'').  The product of these two factors represents the
\textbf{incident flux},
\begin{equation}
  J_{i} = \frac{\hbar k}{m} \;|\Psi_i|^2.
\end{equation}
This has units of $[x^{1-d}t^{-1}]$ (i.e., rate per unit ``area'').

Let us re-imagine this incident flux $J_i$ as a stream of classical
particles, and the scatterer as a ``hard-body'' scatterer that only
interacts with those particles striking it directly:

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.42\textwidth]{crosssection}
\end{figure}

\noindent
In this classical picture, the rate at which the incident particles
strike the scatterer is
\begin{equation}
  I_s = J_i \, \sigma,
\end{equation}
where $\sigma$ is the exposed cross-sectional area of the scatterer.
Comparing this expression to Eq.~\eqref{scatterI}, we see that $\int
d\Omega\,|f|^2$ plays a role analogous to the classical hard-body
cross-sectional area.  We hence call
\begin{equation*}
  \sigma \equiv \int d\Omega\,|f|^2
\end{equation*}
the \textbf{total scattering cross section}.  Moreover, the integrand
$|f|^2$ is called the \textbf{differential scattering cross section},
for it represents the rate, per unit of solid angle, at which
particles are scattered in a given direction.

\section{The Green's function}
\label{sec:greensfun}

The scattering amplitude $f(\Omega)$ can be calculated using a variety
of analytical and numerical methods.  We will discuss one particularly
important approach, based on a quantum variant of the Green's function
technique for solving inhomogenous differential equations.

Let us return to the previously-discussed formulation of the
scattering problem:
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned} \hat{H} &= \hat{H}_0+\hat{V} \\ \hat{H} |\psi\rangle &= E |\psi\rangle \\ |\psi\rangle &= |\psi_i\rangle \,+\, |\psi_s\rangle \\ \hat{H}_0 |\psi_i\rangle &= E |\psi_i\rangle.\end{aligned}
\end{align}
These equations can be combined as follows:
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned} \left(\hat{H}_0 + \hat{V}\right) |\psi_i\rangle + \hat{H} |\psi_s\rangle &= E \left( |\psi_i\rangle + |\psi_s\rangle \right) \\ \Rightarrow \quad \hat{V} |\psi_i\rangle + \hat{H} |\psi_s\rangle &= E |\psi_s\rangle  \\ \Rightarrow \quad\; \left(E - \hat{H}\right) |\psi_s\rangle & = \hat{V} |\psi_i\rangle
  \end{aligned}
\end{align}
To proceed, we define the inverse of the operator on the left-hand
side:
\begin{equation}
  \hat{G} = \big(E-\hat{H}\big)^{-1}.
\end{equation}
This operator is called the \textbf{Green's function}.  Using it, we
get
\begin{equation}
  |\psi_s\rangle = \hat{G} \hat{V} |\psi_i\rangle.
  \label{scatterform}
\end{equation}

Note that $\hat{G}$ depends on both the energy $E$ and the scattering
potential.  To isolate the dependence on the scattering potential, let
us define the Green's function for a free particle,
\begin{equation}
  \hat{G}_0=\big(E-\hat{H}_0\big)^{-1}.
\end{equation}
This will be very useful for us, for $\hat{G}_0$ can be calculated
exactly, whereas $\hat{G}$ often has no analytic expression.  We can
relate $G$ and $G_0$ as follows:
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned}
    \hat{G}(E-\hat{H}_0 - \hat{V})\;\; &= I \;\;\;\mathrm{and}\;\; (E-\hat{H}_0 - \hat{V})\hat{G} = I \\ \Rightarrow \;\;\; \hat{G} \hat{G}_0^{-1} - \hat{G}\hat{V} &= I \;\;\; \mathrm{and}\;\;\;\;\, \hat{G}_0^{-1} \hat{G} - \hat{V}\hat{G} \;\;\;= I.
  \end{aligned}
\end{align}
Upon respectively right-multiplying and left-multiplying these equations
by $\hat{G}_0$, we arrive at the following pair of equations, called
\textbf{Dyson's equations}:
\begin{framed}
  \begin{align}
    \hat{G} \;&= \; \hat{G}_0 + \hat{G}\hat{V}\hat{G}_0 \\
    \hat{G} \;&=\; \hat{G}_0 + \hat{G}_0\hat{V}\hat{G} \label{dyson2}
  \end{align}
\end{framed}
\noindent
These equations are ``implicit'', as the unknown $\hat{G}$ appears in
both the left and right sides.

Applying the second Dyson equation, Eq.~\eqref{dyson2}, to the
scattering problem \eqref{scatterform} gives
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned}|\psi_s\rangle &= \left(\hat{G}_0 + \hat{G}_0\hat{V}\hat{G}\right) \hat{V} |\psi_i\rangle \\ &= \hat{G}_0 \hat{V} |\psi_i\rangle + \hat{G}_0\hat{V}\hat{G} \hat{V} |\psi_i\rangle \\ &= \hat{G}_0 \hat{V} |\psi_i\rangle + \hat{G}_0\hat{V} |\psi_s\rangle \\ &= \hat{G}_0\hat{V} |\psi\rangle.\end{aligned}
  \label{psis_implicity}
\end{align}
This is a useful simplification, since it involves $\hat{G}_0$ rather
than $\hat{G}$.  The downside is that the equation is still implicit:
the right-hand side involves the unknown total state $|\psi\rangle$,
rather than the known incident state $|\psi_i\rangle$.

We can try to solve this implicit equation by using
Eq.~\eqref{psis_implicity} to get an expression for $|\psi\rangle$,
then repeatedly plugging the result back into the right-hand side of
Eq.~\eqref{psis_implicity}.  This yields an infinite series formula:
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned}|\psi_s\rangle &= \hat{G}_0 \hat{V} \left(|\psi_i\rangle + \hat{G}_0 \hat{V}|\psi\rangle\right) \\ &= \quad \vdots \\ &= \left[\hat{G}_0 \hat{V} + (\hat{G}_0 \hat{V})^2 + (\hat{G}_0 \hat{V})^3 + \cdots\right]|\psi_i\rangle.\end{aligned}
\end{align}
Or, equivalently,
\begin{equation}
  |\psi\rangle = \left[\hat{I} + \hat{G}_0 \hat{V} + (\hat{G}_0 \hat{V})^2 + (\hat{G}_0 \hat{V})^3 + \cdots\right]|\psi_i\rangle.
  \label{bornseries}
\end{equation}
This is called the \textbf{Born series}.

To understand the meaning of the Born series, let us go to the
position basis:
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned}\psi(\mathbf{r}) = \psi_i(\mathbf{r}) &+ \int d^dr' \langle \mathbf{r} | \hat{G}_0 |\mathbf{r}'\rangle\, V(\mathbf{r}') \psi_i(\mathbf{r}') \\ &+ \int d^dr' d^dr'' \langle \mathbf{r} | \hat{G}_0 |\mathbf{r}'\rangle\, V(\mathbf{r}') \, \langle \mathbf{r}' | \hat{G}_0 |\mathbf{r}''\rangle \, V(\mathbf{r}'') \psi_i(\mathbf{r}'') \\ &+ \;\;\cdots\end{aligned}
\end{align}
This formula can be regarded as a description of \textbf{multiple
  scattering}.  Due to the presence of the scatterer, the particle
wavefunction is a quantum superposition of terms describing zero, one,
two, or more scattering events, as illustrated in the figure below:

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.98\textwidth]{bornseries}
\end{figure}

\noindent
Each successive term in the Born series involves more scattering
events, i.e., higher multiples of $\hat{V}$.  For example, the
second-order term is
\begin{equation*}
  \int d^dr' d^dr'' \langle \mathbf{r} | \hat{G}_0 |\mathbf{r}'\rangle\, V(\mathbf{r}') \, \langle \mathbf{r}' | \hat{G}_0 |\mathbf{r}''\rangle \, V(\mathbf{r}'') \psi_i(\mathbf{r}'').
\end{equation*}
This describes the particle undergoing the following process: (i)
scattering of the incident particle at point $\mathbf{r}''$, (ii)
propagation from $\mathbf{r}''$ to $\mathbf{r}'$, (iii) scattering
again at point $\mathbf{r}'$, and (iv) propagation from $\mathbf{r}'$
to $\mathbf{r}$.  The scattering points $\mathbf{r}'$ and
$\mathbf{r}''$ are integrated over, with all possible positions
contributing to the result; since the integrals are weighted by $V$,
those positions where the scattering potential are strongest will
contribute the most.

For a sufficiently weak scatterer, it can be a good approximation to
retain just the first few terms in the Born series.  For the rest of
this discussion, let us assume that such an approximation is valid.
(The question of what it means for $\hat{V}$ to be ``sufficiently
weak''---i.e., the exact requirements for the Born series to
converge---is a complex and interesting topic, but one that is beyond
the scope of our present discussion.)

\section{The Green's function for a free particle}
\label{sec:freegreen}

We have defined the free-particle Green's function as the operator
$\hat{G}_0=\big(E-\hat{H}_0\big)^{-1}$.  Its representation in the
position basis, $\langle\mathbf{r}|\hat{G}_0|\mathbf{r}'\rangle$, is
called the \textbf{propagator}.  As we have just seen, when the Born
series is written in the position basis, the propagator appears in the
integrand and describes how the particle ``propagates'' between
discrete scattering events.

The propagator is a solution to a partial differential equation:
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned}\langle\mathbf{r} |\big(E-\hat{H}_0\big) \hat{G}_0 |\mathbf{r}'\rangle &= \langle\mathbf{r}|\hat{I}|\mathbf{r}'\rangle \\ = \left(E + \frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 \right) \langle\mathbf{r} |\hat{G}_0 |\mathbf{r}'\rangle &= \delta^d(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}') \\ \Rightarrow \qquad\quad \left(\nabla^2 + k^2\right) \langle\mathbf{r} |\hat{G}_0 |\mathbf{r}'\rangle &= \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \delta^d(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}').\end{aligned}
\end{align}
As before, $k = \sqrt{2mE/\hbar^2}$ where $E$ is the energy of the
incident particle.  Therefore, up to a factor of $2m/\hbar^2$, the
propagator is the Green's function for the $d$-dimensional Helmholtz
equation (see Section~\ref{sec:2d3d_scattering}).  Note that the
$\nabla^2$ acts upon the $\mathbf{r}$ coordinates, not $\mathbf{r}'$.

To solve for $\langle\mathbf{r}|\hat{G}_0|\mathbf{r}'\rangle$, we can
use the momentum eigenstates:
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned}\langle\mathbf{r}|\hat{G}_0|\mathbf{r}'\rangle &=
    \langle\mathbf{r}|\hat{G}_0 \Big(\int d^dk' |\mathbf{k}'\rangle\langle\mathbf{k}'| \Big) |\mathbf{r}'\rangle \\ &= \int d^dk' \; \langle\mathbf{r}|\mathbf{k}'\rangle \; \frac{1}{E-\frac{\hbar^2|\mathbf{k}'|^2}{2m}} \; \langle\mathbf{k}'|\mathbf{r}'\rangle \\ &= \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \frac{1}{(2\pi)^d} \int d^dk' \; \frac{\exp\left[i\mathbf{k}' \cdot (\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}')\right]}{k^2-|\mathbf{k}'|^2}.\end{aligned}
  \label{rGr}
\end{align}
To proceed, we must specify the spatial dimension $d$.  Let us set $d
= 3$; the calculations for other $d$ are fairly similar.  To calculate
the integral over the 3D wave-vector space, we adopt spherical
coordinates $(k',\theta,\phi)$, with the coordinate axes aligned so
that $\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'$ points along the $\theta=0$ direction.
We can now do the integral:
\begin{align*}
  \begin{aligned}\langle\mathbf{r}|\hat{G}_0|\mathbf{r}'\rangle &= \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \frac{1}{(2\pi)^3} \int d^3k' \; \frac{\exp\left[i\mathbf{k}'\cdot (\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}')\right]}{k^2-|\mathbf{k}'|^2} \\ &= \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \frac{1}{(2\pi)^3} \int_0^\infty dk' \int_0^\pi d\theta \int_{0}^{2\pi} d\phi \;{k'}^{2}\sin\theta\; \frac{\displaystyle \exp\left(ik'|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|\cos\theta\right)}{k^2-{k'}^2} \\ &= \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \frac{1}{(2\pi)^2} \int_0^\infty dk' \int_{-1}^1 d\mu \;{k'}^2\; \frac{\displaystyle \exp\left(ik'|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|\mu\right)}{k^2-{k'}^2} \qquad(\text{letting}\;\mu = \cos\theta) \\ &= \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \frac{1}{(2\pi)^2} \int_0^\infty dk' \; \frac{ {k'}^2}{k^2-{k'}^2}\, \frac{\displaystyle \exp\left(ik'|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|\right) - \exp\left(-ik'|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|\right)}{ik'|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|} \\ &= \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \frac{1}{(2\pi)^2} \frac{i}{|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|} \int_{-\infty}^\infty dk' \; \frac{\displaystyle k'\, \exp\left(ik'|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|\right)}{(k' - k)(k'+k)}\end{aligned}
\end{align*}
This looks like something we can handle with contour integration
techniques.  But there's a snag: the integration contour runs over the
real-$k'$ line, and since $k \in \mathbb{R}^+$, there are two poles
on the contour (at $\pm k$).  Hence, the value of the integral, as
written, is singular.

To make the integral non-singular, we must ``regularize'' it by
tweaking its definition.  One way is to displace the poles
infinitesimally in the complex-$k'$ plane, shifting them off the
contour.  We have a choice of whether to move each pole upwards or
downwards, and this choice turns out to be linked to whether the
Green's function describes waves that are incoming or out-going (or
behave some other way) at infinity.  It turns out that the right
choice for us is to move the pole at $-k$ infinitesimally downwards,
and move the pole at $+k$ infinitesimally upwards:

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.37\textwidth]{greencontour}
\end{figure}

\noindent
This means replacing the denominator of the integrand as
follows:
\begin{equation}
  (k' - k)(k'+k) \;\rightarrow\; (k' - k - i\varepsilon)(k'+k+i\varepsilon) = {k'}^2 - (k+i\varepsilon)^2,
\end{equation}
where $\varepsilon$ is a positive infinitesimal.  This is equivalent
to replacing $E \rightarrow E + i\varepsilon$ in the definition of the
Green's function.  The integral can now be computed as
follows:
\begin{align*}
  \begin{aligned}\int_{-\infty}^\infty dk' \; \frac{\displaystyle k' \exp\left(ik'|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|\right)}{(k' - k)(k'+k)} &\rightarrow \lim_{\varepsilon \rightarrow 0^+} \int_{-\infty}^\infty dk' \; \frac{\displaystyle k' \exp\left(ik'|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|\right)}{(k' - k - i\varepsilon)(k'+k+i\varepsilon)}\;\;\; (\text{regularize}) \\ &= \lim_{\varepsilon \rightarrow 0^+} \int_C dk' \; \frac{\displaystyle k' \exp\left(ik'|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|\right)}{(k' - k - i\varepsilon)(k'+k+i\varepsilon)} \quad\;\;\; (\text{close contour above}) \\ &= 2\pi i \lim_{\varepsilon \rightarrow 0^+} \mathrm{Res}\left[\frac{\displaystyle k' \exp\left(ik'|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|\right)}{(k' - k - i\varepsilon)(k'+k+i\varepsilon)}\right]_{k'=k+i\varepsilon^+} \\ &= \pi i \exp\left(ik|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|\right).\end{aligned}
\end{align*}
Plugging this into Eq.~\eqref{rGr} yields the propagator
$\langle\mathbf{r}|\hat{G}_0|\mathbf{r}'\rangle$.  The final result is
given below, along with the results for $d=1$ and $d=2$ (which are
obtained in a similar fashion):
\begin{framed}
  \begin{equation}
    \langle\mathbf{r}|\hat{G}_0|\mathbf{r}'\rangle = \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \times \begin{cases} \Bigg.\displaystyle\frac{1}{2ik} \exp\left(ik|x-x'|\right),& d=1\\ \Bigg. \displaystyle\frac{1}{4i} H^+_0(k|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'}|), & d=2 \\ \displaystyle \Bigg. - \frac{\exp\left(ik|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|\right)}{4\pi|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|}, & d = 3.  \end{cases}
  \end{equation}
\end{framed}

\vskip -0.15in
The propagator can be regarded as a function of the position
$\mathbf{r}$, describing a wave propagating outwards from a source
point $\mathbf{r}'$.  This outgoing behavior comes from our above
choice of regularization, which tweaked the definition of the Green's
function to be
\begin{framed}
  \begin{equation}
    \hat{G_0} = \lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow 0^+} \big(E - \hat{H}_0 + i \varepsilon\big)^{-1}.
  \end{equation}
\end{framed}
\vskip -0.15in
\noindent
This is called an \textbf{outgoing} or \textbf{causal Green's
  function}.  The word ``causal'' refers to the concept of
``cause-and-effect'': i.e., a source at one point of space (the
``cause'') leads to the emission of waves that move outwards (the
``effect'').

Different regularizations produce Green's functions with alternative
features.  For instance, we could flip the sign of $i\varepsilon$ in
the Green's function redefinition, which displaces the $k$-space poles
in the opposite direction.  The resulting propagator
$\langle\mathbf{r}|\hat{G}_0|\mathbf{r}'\rangle$ is
complex-conjugated, and describes a wave moving inwards from infinity,
``sinking'' into the point $\mathbf{r}'$.  Such a choice of
regularization thus corresponds to an \textbf{incoming Green's
  function}.  In the scattering problem, we will always deal with the
outgoing/causal Green's function.

\section{Scattering amplitudes in 3D}
\label{sec:3damp}

The propagator can now be plugged into the scattering problem
posed in Sections~\ref{sec:scattering_amplitude}--\ref{sec:greensfun}:
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned} \psi_i(\mathbf{r}) &= \Psi_i \, e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}}, \\ \psi_s(\mathbf{r}) &= \langle\mathbf{r}| \hat{G}_0 \hat{V} |\psi\rangle \;\; \overset{r\rightarrow\infty}{\longrightarrow}\;\; \Psi_i \, r^{\frac{1-d}{2}} \, e^{ikr} \, f(\mathbf{k}_i\rightarrow k\hat{\mathbf{r}}).
  \end{aligned}
\end{align}
Our goal is to determine the scattering amplitude $f$.  We will focus
on the 3D case; the 1D and 2D cases are handled in a similar way.

In the $r\rightarrow\infty$ limit, the propagator can be simplified
using the Taylor expansion
\begin{equation}
  |\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}'| = r - \hat{\mathbf{r}} \cdot \mathbf{r}' + \cdots,
\end{equation}
where $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ denotes the unit vector pointing parallel to
$\mathbf{r}$.  (This is the same ``large-$r$'' expansion used in
deriving the electric dipole moment in classical electromagnetism.)
Applying this to the 3D outgoing propagator gives, to lowest order,
\begin{equation}
  \langle\mathbf{r}|\hat{G}_0|\mathbf{r}'\rangle \overset{r\rightarrow\infty}{\approx} - \frac{2m}{\hbar^2}\, \frac{e^{ikr}}{4\pi r}\; \exp\left(-ik \, \hat{\mathbf{r}} \cdot \mathbf{r}'\right)
\end{equation}
Hence, the scattered wavefunction is
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned}\psi_s(\mathbf{r}) &\;\;= \;\; \int d^3r'\; \langle\mathbf{r}|\hat{G}_0|\mathbf{r}'\rangle\, V(\mathbf{r}')\, \psi(\mathbf{r}') \\ &\overset{r\rightarrow\infty}{\approx} \, - \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \, \frac{e^{ikr}}{4\pi r}\; \int d^3r' \exp\left(-ik \, \hat{\mathbf{r}} \cdot \mathbf{r}'\right)\, V(\mathbf{r}')\, \psi(\mathbf{r}') \\ &\;\;=\;\; - \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \, \frac{e^{ikr}}{4\pi r} \; (2\pi)^{3/2} \; \big\langle \mathbf{k}_f \big|\hat{V}\big|\psi\big\rangle, \;\;\;\mathrm{where}\;\; \mathbf{k}_f \equiv k \hat{\mathbf{r}}. \end{aligned}
\end{align}
We can combine this with the Green's function relation from
Section~\ref{sec:greensfun},
\begin{equation}
  |\psi\rangle = \left(\hat{I} + \hat{G}\hat{V}\right)|\psi_i\rangle.
\end{equation}
This yields
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned}\psi_s(\mathbf{r}) \; &\overset{r\rightarrow\infty}{\longrightarrow} \; - \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \, \frac{e^{ikr}}{r} \; \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}} \; \big\langle \mathbf{k}_f \big|\hat{V} + \hat{V}\hat{G}\hat{V}\big|\psi_i\big\rangle \\ &= - \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \, \Psi_i\, \frac{e^{ikr}}{r} \; 2\pi^2 \; \big\langle \mathbf{k}_f \big|\hat{V} + \hat{V}\hat{G}\hat{V}\big|\mathbf{k}_i\big\rangle.\end{aligned}
\end{align}
This can be compared to the earlier definition of the scattering amplitude,
\begin{equation}
  \psi_s(\mathbf{r}) \; \overset{r\rightarrow\infty}{\longrightarrow} \; \Psi_i \frac{e^{ikr}}{r} f(\mathbf{k}_i\rightarrow \mathbf{k}_f ).
\end{equation}
Hence, we find that
\begin{framed}
  \begin{align}
    \begin{aligned}
      f(\mathbf{k}_i \rightarrow \mathbf{k}_f) &= - \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \,\cdot \, 2\pi^2 \; \big\langle \mathbf{k}_f\big| \hat{V} + \hat{V}\hat{G} \hat{V} \big|\mathbf{k}_i\big\rangle \\
      &= - \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \,\cdot \, 2\pi^2 \; \big\langle \mathbf{k}_f\big| \hat{V} + \hat{V}\hat{G}_0 \hat{V} + \hat{V} \hat{G}_0 \hat{V} \hat{G}_0\hat{V} + \cdots \big|\mathbf{k}_i\big\rangle,  \end{aligned}
  \end{align}
\end{framed}
\vskip -0.15in
\noindent
subject to the elasticity constraint $|\mathbf{k}_i| =
|\mathbf{k}_f|$.  In deriving the last line, we used the Born series
formula \eqref{bornseries}.

This result is the culmination of the numerous definitions and
derivations from the preceding sections.  On the left side is the
scattering amplitude, the fundamental quantity of interest in
scattering experiments.  The right side contains quantities that are
known to us, or that can be calculated: the initial and final momenta,
the scattering potential, and the Green's function.  Although this
result was derived for the 3D case, very similar formulas hold for
other dimensions, but with the $2\pi^2$ factor replaced with other
numerical factors.

\section{Example: uniform spherical well in 3D}

Let us test the Born series against a simple example, consisting of
the scattering potential
\begin{equation}
  V(\mathbf{r}) = \begin{cases}-U, & |\mathbf{r}| \le R \\ \;\;\;\,0,
    & |\mathbf{r}| > 0. \end{cases}
\end{equation}
We will assume that $U > 0$, so that the potential is attactive and
describes a uniform spherically symmetric well of depth $U$ and radius
$R$, surrounded by empty space.  For this potential, the scattering
problem can be solved exactly, using the method of \textbf{partial
  wave analysis} described in Appendix A.  The resulting scattering
amplitudes are
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}f(\mathbf{k}_i \rightarrow \mathbf{k}_f) &= \frac{1}{2ik}\, \sum_{\ell =0}^\infty \big(e^{2i\delta_\ell} - 1\big) \big(2\ell+1\big)\, P_{\ell}(\hat{\mathbf{k}}_i\cdot \hat{\mathbf{k}}_f), \\ \mathrm{where}\;\; \delta_\ell &= \frac{\pi}{2} + \mathrm{arg}\!\left[k {h_\ell^+}'(kR) \, j_\ell(qR) - qh_\ell^+(kR)\, j_\ell'(qR)\right], \\ q &= \sqrt{2m(E+U)/\hbar^2} \\ k &\equiv |\mathbf{k}_i| = |\mathbf{k}_f|.\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
This solution is expressed in terms of various special functions;
$j_\ell$ and $h_\ell$ are the spherical Bessel function of the first
kind and spherical Hankel function, while $P_\ell$ is the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre_polynomials}{\textbf{Legendre
    polynomial}} (which appears in the definition of the spherical
harmonic functions).

We will pit this exact solution against the results from the Born
series:
\begin{equation}
  f(\mathbf{k}_i\rightarrow \mathbf{k}_f) \approx - \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \,\cdot \, 2\pi^2 \, \Bigg[\big\langle \mathbf{k}_f\big| \hat{V}|\mathbf{k}_i\big\rangle + \big\langle \mathbf{k}_f \big| \hat{V}\hat{G}_0 \hat{V} \big|\mathbf{k}_i\big\rangle + \cdots \Bigg].
\end{equation}
The bra-kets can be evaluated in the position representation.  Let us
do this for just the first two terms in the series:
\begin{align*}
  \begin{aligned}f(\mathbf{k}_i\rightarrow \mathbf{k}_f) &\approx - \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \; 2\pi^2 \Bigg[\int d^3r_1\; \frac{\exp(-i\mathbf{k}_f \cdot \mathbf{r}_1)}{(2\pi)^{3/2}} \, V(\mathbf{r}_1) \, \frac{\exp(i\mathbf{k}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_1)}{(2\pi)^{3/2}} \\&\qquad\qquad\quad + \int d^3r_1 \!\! \int d^3r_2 \; \frac{\exp(-i\mathbf{k}_f \cdot \mathbf{r}_2)}{(2\pi)^{3/2}} \, V(\mathbf{r}_2) \, \langle\mathbf{r}_2|\hat{G}_0|\mathbf{r}_1 \rangle \, V(\mathbf{r}_1)\, \frac{\exp(i\mathbf{k}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_1)}{(2\pi)^{3/2}}\Bigg] \\ &= \frac{1}{4\pi} \Bigg[\frac{2mU}{\hbar^2} \int_{|\mathbf{r}_1| \le R} d^3r_1 \; \exp\left[i(\mathbf{k}_i-\mathbf{k}_f)\, \cdot\, \mathbf{r}_1\right] \\ &\qquad + \left(\frac{2mU}{\hbar^2}\right)^2\, \int_{|\mathbf{r}_1|<R} d^3 r_1 \int_{|\mathbf{r}_2|<R} d^3 r_2 \; \frac{\exp\left[i(k|\mathbf{r}_1-\mathbf{r}_2| - \mathbf{k}_f \cdot \mathbf{r}_2 +\mathbf{k}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_1)\right]}{4\pi|\mathbf{r}_1-\mathbf{r}_2|} \Bigg]. \end{aligned}
\end{align*}
If we use only the first term in the Born series, the result is
called the ``first Born approximation''; if we use two terms, the
result is called the ``second Born approximation''.  Higher-order Born
approximations can be derived in a similar fashion.

The most expedient way to calculate these integrals is to use the
numerical method known as
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_integration}{Monte
  Carlo integration}.  To find an integral of the form
\begin{equation}
  I = \int_{|\mathrm{r}|<R} d^3r \, F(\mathbf{r}),
\end{equation}
we randomly sample $N$ points within a cube of volume $(2R)^3$
centered around the origin, enclosing the desired sphere of radius
$R$.  For the $n$-th sampled point, $\mathbf{r}_n$, we compute
\begin{equation}
  F_n = \begin{cases}F(\mathbf{r}_n), & |\mathbf{r}| < R \\ 0, &\mathrm{otherwise}.\end{cases}
\end{equation}
The $F_n$'s give the values of the integrand at the sampling points,
omitting the contribution from points outside the sphere.  Then we
estimate the integral as
\begin{equation}
  I \,\approx\, (2R)^3 \, \langle F_n\rangle \,=\, \frac{(2R)^3}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N F_n.
\end{equation}
The estimate converges to the true value as $N\rightarrow\infty$; in
practice, $N \sim 10^4$ yields a good result for typical 3D integrals,
and can be computed in around a second on a modern computer.
Similarly, to calculate the double integral appearing in the second
term of the Born series, we sample \textit{pairs} of points; the
volume factor $(2R)^3$ is then replaced by $(2R)^6$.

This method for calculating the Born series can be readily generalized
to more complicated scattering potentials, including potentials for
which there is no exact solution.

The figure below shows the results of the Born approximation for the
uniform potential well, compared to the ``exact'' solution computed
from partial wave analysis.  It plots $|f|^2$ versus the scattering
energy $E$, for the case of $90^\circ$ scattering (i.e.,
$\mathbf{k}_f$ perpendicular to $\mathbf{k}_i$), with wells of
different depth $U$ and the same radius $R = 1$.  We adopt
computational units $\hbar = m = 1$, and each Monte Carlo integral is
computed using $3\times10^4$ samples.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.97\textwidth]{spherical_well_scattering}
\end{figure}

The first thing to notice in these results in that $|f|^2$ diminishes
to zero for large $E$.  This makes sense.  The scattering potential
has some energy scale ($U$), and if the incident particle is highly
energetic ($E \gg U$), it will just zoom through, with little chance
of being deflected.

Looking more closely at the plots, we see that for the shallower well
($U = 0.1$), the first Born approximation is in good agreement with
the exact results; the second Born approximation is even better,
particularly for small $E$.  But for the deeper well ($U = 1$), the
Born approximations do not match the exact results at all.  One way to
interpret this is that as a scattering potential gets stronger, an
incident particle has a higher chance to undergo multiple-scattering
(i.e., bouncing around the potential multiple times before escaping),
which means that higher terms in the Born series become more
important.  In fact, if the potential is too strong, even taking the
Born approximation to higher orders might not work, because the Born
series can become non-convergent.  In those cases, different methods
must be brought to bear.  We will see an example in the next chapter,
in the form of phenomena known as ``scattering resonances''.
