\section{Bound states and free states}

A curious feature of wavefunctions in infinite space is that they come
in two distinct varieties: (i) \textbf{bound states} that are
localized to one region, like the ground state of a harmonic
oscillator, and (ii) \textbf{free states} that extend over the whole
space, like plane waves.

Both kinds of states can co-exist in one system, as demonstrated by
the \textbf{1D finite square well}.  Consider the Hamiltonian
\begin{equation}
  \hat{H} = \frac{\hat{p}^2}{2m} - U \,\Theta(a -|\hat{x}|),
\end{equation}
where $\hat{x}$ and $\hat{p}$ are 1D position and momentum operators,
$m$ is the particle mass, $U$ and $a$ are positive real parameters,
and $\Theta$ denotes the step function (i.e., 1 if the input is
positive, and 0 otherwise).  As illustrated below, the potential well
has depth $U$ and width $2a$.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.57\textwidth]{squarewell}
\end{figure}

We can solve the time-independent Schr\"odinger wave equation for this
Hamiltonian using a simple technique called the \textbf{transfer
  matrix method}.  Some key aspects of the calculation are described
below; the rest of the details are given in Appendix B.

Outside the potential well, the Schr\"odinger wave equation reduces to
\begin{equation}
  -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\,\frac{d^2\psi}{dx^2} = E \psi(x)
  \qquad (\text{for}\;\;|x| > a).  
  \label{eq:psioutside}
\end{equation}
For $E < 0$, we can find solutions of the form
\begin{equation}
  \psi(x) = c_\pm\, e^{\mp\kappa x},\;\;\;\mathrm{where}\;\;
  c_\pm \in \mathbb{C}, \;\;
  \kappa = \sqrt{-\frac{2mE}{\hbar^2}} \in \mathbb{R}^+.
\end{equation}
By choosing $e^{-\kappa x}$ for $x > a$, and $e^{+\kappa x}$ for $x <
-a$, we can construct solutions that vanish exponentially in each
direction away from the potential well.  It can be shown that the
resulting wavefunction is normalizable to unity.  There is also a
lower bound for $E$ stemming from the variational principle: $E \ge
-U$.  Hence, bound states are restricted to the energy range $-U \le E
< 0$.  The bound state energies can be shown to form a
\textit{discrete} set of values within this range (this comes from the
analysis of ``Sturm-Liouville-type'' differential equations, as
described in textbooks such as Courant and Hilbert
[\ref{cite:CourantHilbert}]).

For $E > 0$, we cannot construct such exponentially localized
solutions.  Instead, we find solutions of the form
\begin{equation}
  \psi(x) = \begin{cases} \alpha_-\, e^{ik x} + \beta_-\, e^{-ik x}, & \;\;\;x < -a\\ (\mathrm{something}) , & -a < x < a\\ \alpha_+\, e^{ik x} + \beta_+\, e^{-ik x} , & \;\;\,x > a,\end{cases}
  \quad\mathrm{where}\;\;\;
  k = \sqrt{\frac{2mE}{\hbar^2}} \in \mathbb{R}^+.
  \label{psiwaves}
\end{equation}
Because combinations of plane waves are bounded in amplitude, such a
solution is reasonably well-behaved, in the sense that the
wavefunction itself does not blow up as $|x| \rightarrow \pm\infty$.
However, $\int_{-\infty}^\infty |\psi(x)|^2 dx$ is divergent, so the
wavefunction cannot be normalized to unity.

For each $E$, we can find coefficients $\alpha_\pm$ and $\beta_\pm$
for Eq.~\eqref{psiwaves} so as to satisfy the Schr\"odinger wave
equation.  It turns out that these four coefficients are not
independent; for example, if we fix $\alpha_\pm$, then that uniquely
determines $\beta_\pm$ (see Appendix B).  Since such free state
solutions can be constructed for \textit{every} $E \ge 0$, they form a
continuous family of solutions.

The following figure shows numerically obtained results for a square
well with $U = 30$ and $a=1$ (in units where $\hbar = m =1$).  The
energy spectrum is shown on the left side.  There are five discrete
bound states; their plots of $|\psi|^2$ versus $x$ are shown on the
right side.  These results were computed using the transfer matrix
method described in Appendix B.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.72\textwidth]{boundvsextended}
\end{figure}

The number of bound states depends on the potential.  The figure below
plots the bound state energies for the square well with fixed $a = 1$,
versus the potential minimum $-U$:

\vskip 0.15in
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.68\textwidth]{boundstate1d}
\end{figure}

\noindent
For $U = 30$, there are five bound states, which disappear one by one
as the potential well gets shallower.  Note that one bound state
survives in the limit $U \rightarrow 0$.  There is a theorem stating
that any 1D attractive potential, no matter how weak, always supports
at least one bound state.  For details, see
\hyperref[ex:boundstate]{Exercise 1}.

Many of the lessons drawn from this 1D square well model can be
generalized to more complicated potentials, including models in higher
spatial dimensions.  One notable difference: in 3D, it is possible for
an attractive potential to be too weak to support a bound state.
Intuitively, this happens when the zero-point energy of a prospective
ground state exceeds the well depth.  The figure below shows a
numerical example based on a uniform 3D spherically symmetric well
(the $l$ labels are angular momentum quantum numbers).  To learn more
about this phenomenon, refer to \hyperref[ex:boundstate3d]{Exercise
  2}.

\section{Quasi-bound states and resonances}
\label{sec:resonances}

For the 1D finite square well, there is a clear distinction between
bound and free states.  Certain potentials, however, can host special
states called ``\textbf{quasi-bound states}''.  Similar to a bound
state, a quasi-bound state is strongly concentrated in one region of
space; however, its energy lies within the energy range of the
continuum of free states.  As we shall see, quasi-bound states play an
important important role in scattering experiments.

The figure below shows an example of a potential function that gives
rise to quasi-bound states.  In the exterior region, $|x| > b$, the
potential is zero.  Between $x = -b$ and $x = b$, there is a
``barrier'' of positive potential $V_b$.  Embedded in the middle of
this barrier is a central well of depth $U$ and width $2a$, such that
$0 < V_b - U < V_b$.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{resonancewell}
\end{figure}

\noindent
The potential is purely repulsive (i.e., $V \ge 0$ everywhere), so
there are no true bound states.  All the exact eigenstates of the
Hamiltonian must be free states.

However, there is something intriguing about the central well.
Consider an alternative scenario where the potential in the exterior
region is $V_b$ rather than $0$, so that
\begin{equation}
  V_{\mathrm{alt}}(x) = \begin{cases}V_b - U, & |x| < a, \\ V_b, & \mathrm{otherwise}.\end{cases}
\end{equation}
This describes a finite square well, which should have one or more
bound states in the energy range $V_b-U < E < V_b$.  For each of these
bound states, the wavefunction $\psi(x)$ diminishes exponentially away
from the well, so $\psi(x) \approx 0$ for $|x| > b$.  But $V(x)$ and
$V_{\mathrm{alt}}(x)$ differ only in the region $|x| > b$, which
implies that $\psi(x)$ is a good \textit{approximate} solution to the
Schr\"odinger equation for the original potential $V(x)$, in spite of
the fact that $V(x)$ does not support true bound states!  We call such
an approximate solution a quasi-bound state.

We can also analyze the situation using the scattering framework from
Chapter 1.  Consider an incident particle of energy $E > 0$ whose
wavefunction is
\begin{equation}
  \psi_i(x) = \Psi_i \, e^{ik_i x}.
\end{equation}
This produces a scattered wavefunction, which takes the following form
in the exterior region:
\begin{equation}
  \psi_s(x) = \Psi_i \times \begin{cases}f_- \,e^{-ik_ix}, & x \le -b \\ f_+ \,e^{ik_ix}, & x \ge b.\end{cases}
\end{equation}
The scattering amplitudes $f_+$ and $f_-$ can be found by solving the
Schr\"odinger wave equation using the transfer matrix method (see
Appendix B).  The figure below shows numerical results obtained for $U
= 20,\,V_b = 30,\,a=1$, and $b \in \{ 1.2, 1.4\}$, with $\hbar = m =
1$.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{resonances}
\end{figure}

The vertical axis shows the \textbf{transmittance} $|1+f_+|^2$, which
is the probability for the particle to pass through the scatterer.
The horizontal axis is the particle energy $E$.  Unsurprisingly, for
$E < V_b-U$ the transmittance approaches zero, and for $E \gtrsim V_b$
it approaches unity.  For $V_b-U < E \lesssim V_b$, the transmittance
forms a series of narrow peaks; for larger $b$ (i.e., when the central
well is more isolated from the exterior space), the peaks are
narrower.  At the top of the figure, we have also plotted the bound
state energies for the square well potential $V_{\mathrm{alt}}(x)$.
These energies closely match the locations of the transmittance peaks!

If we look at the total wavefunction $\psi(x)$, we find other
interesting features.  Below, we plot $|\psi(x)|^2$ versus $x$ at the
energies of the first three transmittance peaks, along with the
corresponding bound state wavefunctions for $V_{\mathrm{alt}}$.  At
each transmittance peak, $|\psi(x)|^2$ is very large in the potential
region, and its shape is very similar to a bound state of
$V_{\mathrm{alt}}$.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.83\textwidth]{resonancewavefunctions}
\end{figure}

\noindent
The enhancement of $|\psi(x)|^2$ is called a \textbf{resonance}.
Roughly speaking, the incident particle enters the scatterer, and
spends a long time trapped in the quasi-bound state, before eventually
leaking out and escaping to infinity.

This is analogous to the phenomenon of resonance in a classical
harmonic oscillator.  When a damped harmonic oscillator is subjected
to a periodic driving force, it settles into a steady-state
oscillation at the driving frequency.  If the driving frequency
matches the oscillator's natural frequency, the system is ``resonant''
and the oscillation amplitude becomes large.  Here, the incident
wavefunction plays the role of a driving force, its energy is like the
driving frequency, and the energy of the quasi-bound state is like the
natural frequency.

Resonances play a critical role throughout experimental physics.
Experiments are often conducted for the express purpose of locating
and studying resonances.  When a resonance peak is found, its location
and shape can be used to deduce various features of the quasi-bound
state, which in turn supplies important information about the
underlying system.

\section{Green's function analysis of scattering resonances}
\label{sec:green_resonances}

The quantum Green's function formalism, developed in Chapter 1,
provides a powerful and general way to understand quasi-bound states
and resonances.  Notably, this framework applies not only to 1D
models, but works for higher dimensions as well.

Let $\hat{H} = \hat{T} + \hat{V}$ be the Hamiltonian of a system
supporting resonances, where $\hat{T}$ is the kinetic energy operator
and $\hat{V}$ is the potential operator.  We decompose the potential
into
\begin{equation}
  \hat{V} = \hat{V}_0 + \hat{V}_1,
  \label{Vdecomp}
\end{equation}
where $\hat{V}_0$ is a ``confining potential'' that supports a bound
state, and $\hat{V}_1$ is a ``deconfining potential'' that turns the
bound state into a quasi-bound state.  For example, the potential
functions for the 1D model of the previous section are shown below:

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{resonancewell_decomp}
\end{figure}

\noindent
(Note that this 1D case is just an illustration; Eq.~\eqref{Vdecomp}
applies to higher dimensions too.)

When the potential is just $\hat{V}_0$, let there be a bound state
$|\varphi\rangle$ with energy $E_0$.  Furthermore, let us assume that
the potential supports a continuum of free states $\{|\psi_k\rangle\}$
with energies $\{E_k\}$, where $k$ is some continuous index for
labelling the free states (we will discuss what this index might
represent later).  The states satisfy the Schr\"odinger equation
\begin{align}
  \big(\hat{T} + \hat{V}_0\big) |\varphi\rangle \; &= E_0 |\varphi\rangle \\ \big(\hat{T} + \hat{V}_0\big) |\psi_k\rangle &= E_k |\psi_k\rangle,
\end{align}
along with the orthogonality and completeness relations
\begin{equation}
  \langle\varphi|\psi_k\rangle = 0, \;\;\quad |\varphi\rangle\langle\varphi|
  + \sum_k \, |\psi_k\rangle\langle\psi_k| = \hat{I}.
\end{equation}
Here, $\sum_k$ represents a sum over all free states.  Since the free
states form a continuum, this sum will have to be expressed as an
integral by re-normalizing the free states (e.g., delta
normalization), as discussed in Section 1.2.  For the moment, however,
we will leave it as a discrete sum, with the free states normalized to
unity.

We can now treat $\hat{V}$ as a scattering potential, and compute the
Green's function.  According to Dyson's equations (Section~1.6), the
Green's function for the full system is
\begin{equation}
  \hat{G} = \hat{G}_0 + \hat{G} \hat{V}_1 \hat{G}_0,
  \label{Gdyson}
\end{equation}
where the causal Green's function (Section 1.7) is
\begin{equation}
  \hat{G}_0(E) = \lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow0^+}
  \Big(E - \hat{T} - \hat{V}_0 + i\varepsilon\Big)^{-1}.
\end{equation}
Note that Eq.~\eqref{Gdyson} is exact, not an approximation.  If we
are able to obtain $\hat{G}(E)$, we will be able to determine the
scattering amplitudes.

Let us find the matrix elements of $\hat{G}(E)$ by using
$|\varphi\rangle$ and $\{|\psi_k\rangle\}$ as a convenient basis.
Note, however, that this is \textit{not} the energy eigenbasis of
$\hat{H}$.

As usual when dealing with Dyson's equations, we must beware of the
fact that $\hat{G}$ appears on both the left- and right-hand sides.
We judiciously insert a resolution of the identity as follows:
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned}
    \hat{G} \;=\; \hat{G}_0 + \hat{G} \hat{I} \hat{V}_1 \hat{G}_0
    \;=\; \hat{G}_0 + \hat{G} \left(|\varphi\rangle\langle\varphi|
    + \sum_k\, |\psi_k\rangle\langle\psi_k|\right) \hat{V}_1 \hat{G}_0.
  \end{aligned}
\end{align}
We then compute the matrix element
$\langle\varphi|\cdots|\varphi\rangle$ for both sides:
\begin{align}
    \langle\varphi|\hat{G}|\varphi\rangle = \langle\varphi|\hat{G}_0|\varphi\rangle &+ \langle\varphi|\hat{G}|\varphi\rangle \, \langle\varphi|\hat{V}_1 \hat{G}_0|\varphi\rangle + \sum_k\, \langle\varphi|\hat{G}|\psi_k\rangle \, \langle\psi_k| \hat{V}_1 \hat{G}_0|\varphi\rangle \nonumber\\
    \langle\varphi|\hat{G}|\varphi\rangle \left(1 - \langle\varphi|\hat{V}_1 \hat{G}_0|\varphi\rangle\right) &= \langle\varphi|\hat{G}_0|\varphi\rangle + \sum_k \, \langle\varphi|\hat{G}|\psi_k\rangle \, \langle\psi_k| \hat{V}_1 \hat{G}_0|\varphi\rangle \nonumber\\
    \lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow0^+}
    \langle\varphi|\hat{G}|\varphi\rangle \left(1 - \frac{\langle\varphi|\hat{V}_1|\varphi\rangle}{E - E_0 + i\varepsilon}\right) &= \lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow0^+} \frac{1}{E  - E_0 + i\varepsilon} \left(1+ \sum_k \, \langle\varphi|\hat{G}|\psi_k\rangle \, \langle\psi_k| \hat{V}_1|\varphi\rangle \right) \nonumber\\
    \lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow0^+} \langle\varphi|\hat{G}|\varphi\rangle \Big(E - E_0 -\, \langle\varphi|\hat{V}_1|\varphi\rangle \, & + i\varepsilon\Big) - \sum_k\, \langle\varphi|\hat{G}|\psi_k\rangle \, \langle\psi_k| \hat{V}_1|\varphi\rangle = 1. \label{psiGphi}
\end{align}
Similarly, computing the matrix element
$\langle\varphi|\cdots|\psi_k\rangle$ gives
\begin{align*}
  \begin{aligned}
\langle\varphi|\hat{G}|\psi_k\rangle &= \langle\varphi|\hat{G}_0|\psi_k\rangle + \langle\varphi|\hat{G}|\varphi\rangle \, \langle\varphi|\hat{V}_1 \hat{G}_0|\psi_k\rangle + \sum_{k'}\, \langle\varphi|\hat{G}|\psi_{k'}\rangle \, \langle\psi_{k'}| \hat{V}_1 \hat{G}_0|\psi_k\rangle \\
&= \lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow0^+} \left(E-E_k+i\varepsilon\right)^{-1} \left(\langle\varphi|\hat{G}|\varphi\rangle \, \langle\varphi|\hat{V}_1|\psi_k\rangle + \sum_{k'}\, \langle\varphi|\hat{G}|\psi_{k'}\rangle \, \langle\psi_{k'}| \hat{V}_1|\psi_k\rangle\right).\end{aligned}
\end{align*}

So far, the equations have been exact, but now we apply an
approximation: in the last line of the above equation, let the factor
of $\langle\varphi|G|\varphi\rangle$ be large, so that the first term
in the sum becomes dominant.  It will be shown below that
$\langle\varphi|G|\varphi\rangle$ being large is precisely the
resonance condition, so this approximation will be self-consistent.

With this, we obtain
\begin{equation}
  \langle\varphi|\hat{G}|\psi_k\rangle \approx \lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow0^+} \frac{\langle\varphi|\hat{G}|\varphi\rangle \, \langle\varphi|\hat{V}_1|\psi_k\rangle}{E-E_k+i\varepsilon}.
  \label{phiGpsi}
\end{equation}
Combining this with Eq.~\eqref{psiGphi} gives
\begin{equation*}
  \lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow0^+} \left[\langle\varphi|\hat{G}|\varphi\rangle \left(E - E_0 -\, \langle\varphi|\hat{V}_1|\varphi\rangle \, + i\varepsilon\right) - \sum_k\, \frac{\langle\varphi|\hat{G}|\varphi\rangle\langle\varphi|\hat{V}_1|\psi_k\rangle}{E-E_k+i\varepsilon} \, \langle\psi_k| \hat{V}_1|\varphi\rangle\right] \approx 1.
\end{equation*}

Hence, we arrive at the result
\begin{framed}
  \begin{align}
    \langle\varphi|\,\hat{G}(E)\,|\varphi\rangle
    &\approx \frac{1}{\displaystyle E - E_0 - \langle\varphi|V_1|\varphi\rangle - \Sigma(E)}
    \label{phiGphi_result} \\
    \mathrm{where}\quad
    \Sigma(E) &\equiv \lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow0^+}
    \sum_k \, \frac{\displaystyle| \langle\psi_k| \hat{V}_1|\varphi\rangle|^2}{\displaystyle E-E_k+i\varepsilon}.
    \label{sigma}
  \end{align}
\end{framed}

\section{The self energy}
\label{sec:self_energy}

The enigmatic quantity $\Sigma(E)$ defined in Eq.~\eqref{sigma} is
called the \textbf{self energy}.  If we put aside its dependence on
$E$, treating it as a constant, Eq.~\eqref{phiGphi_result} looks a lot
like the Green's function of a system with an energy eigenstate of
energy $E_0 + \langle\varphi|\hat{V}_1|\varphi\rangle + \Sigma$.  We
can think of this as the energy of the quasi-bound state, but such an
interpretation is complicated by the fact that $\Sigma$ is not real
but complex, as we will see below.

First, however, let us examine the real part of $\Sigma$.  According
to Eq.~\eqref{phiGphi_result},
$\langle\varphi|\hat{G}(E)|\varphi\rangle$ is large when the
denominator is close to zero---which, by the way, is consistent with
the assumption made in obtaining Eq.~\eqref{phiGpsi}.  Since $E$ is
real, this happens at the energy
\begin{equation}
  E \;\approx\; E_0 + \langle\varphi|\hat{V}_1|\varphi\rangle + \mathrm{Re}\big[\,\Sigma\,\big]  \,\equiv \, E_{\mathrm{res}}.
  \label{Eres}
\end{equation}
This resonance energy consists of the energy of the original bound
state, plus two energy shifts: one coming directly from the
deconfining potential $\hat{V}_1$ (as expected), and the other being
$\mathrm{Re}[\Sigma]$.  According to Eq.~\eqref{sigma}, the latter
energy shift arises from the interplay between $|\varphi\rangle$ and
the free states $\{|\psi_k\rangle\}$.  We can thus interpret this part
of the quasi-bound state's energy as arising from the disturbance of
the free state continuum by the quasi-bound state itself---hence the
term ``self energy''.

Next, we look at $\mathrm{Im}[\Sigma]$, which will turn out to be
nonzero.  What does it mean for an energy to have an imaginary part?
If an energy eigenstate has energy $\Sigma$, its time dependence goes
as $\exp(-i\Sigma t/\hbar)$.  Writing $\Sigma = \mathrm{Re}[\Sigma] +
i \mathrm{Im}[\Sigma]$, the exponential factor decomposes into
\begin{equation*}
  \exp(-i\mathrm{Re}[\Sigma] t/\hbar) \,\exp(\mathrm{Im}[\Sigma] t/\hbar).
\end{equation*}
Hence, the imaginary part of the energy corresponds to a rate of
amplification ($\mathrm{Im}[\Sigma] > 0$) or decay
($\mathrm{Im}[\Sigma] < 0$).

With this in mind, let us take the imaginary part of
Eq.~\eqref{sigma}:
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned}\mathrm{Im}\big[\Sigma(E)\big] &= \lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow0^+} \sum_k\, \Big| \langle\psi_k| \hat{V}_1|\varphi\rangle\Big|^2 \; \mathrm{Im}\left( \frac{1}{\displaystyle E-E_k+i\varepsilon}\right) \\ &= - \sum_k\, \Big| \langle\psi_k| \hat{V}_1|\varphi\rangle\Big|^2 \; \left[ \lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow0^+} \; \frac{\varepsilon}{\displaystyle (E-E_k)^2 + \varepsilon^2}\right].\end{aligned}
\end{align}
The quantity in the square brackets is a Lorentzian function of
width $\varepsilon$.  The area under the curve is $\pi$, independent
of $\varepsilon$, so it has the limiting form
\begin{equation}
  \lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow 0^+} \frac{\varepsilon}{x^2+\varepsilon^2} = \pi\delta(x).
\end{equation}
We conclude that
\begin{equation}
  \mathrm{Im}\big[\Sigma(E)\big]
  = - \pi \sum_k \; \big| \langle\psi_k| \hat{V}_1|\varphi\rangle\big|^2
  \; \delta(E-E_k).
  \label{fermigr1}
\end{equation}
Clearly, $\mathrm{Im}[\Sigma] < 0$, so this describes a decay rate.
Every free state with energy equal to $E$ contributes to
$\mathrm{Im}[\Sigma(E)]$, weighted by the overlap factor $|
\langle\psi_k| \hat{V}_1|\varphi\rangle|^2$.  In
Section~\ref{sec:goldenrule}, we will discuss this decay rate in more
detail.

\section{Scattering resonances}
\label{sec:scattering_resonances}

In Section 1.8, we derived the following relationship between the
Green's function and the scattering amplitude $f$:
\begin{equation}
  f(\mathbf{k}\rightarrow\mathbf{k}') \;\propto\; \langle \mathbf{k}'|\hat{V}|\mathbf{k}\rangle + \langle \mathbf{k}'|\hat{V}\hat{G}\hat{V}|\mathbf{k}\rangle.
\end{equation}
Here, $|\mathbf{k}\rangle$ and $|\mathbf{k}'\rangle$ are incident and
scattered plane wave states satisfying $|\mathbf{k}|=|\mathbf{k}'|$.
The first term describes the lowest-order scattering process (the
first Born approximation).  The second term contains all second- and
higher-order scattering processes.  By inserting resolutions of the
identity between each $\hat{V}$ and $\hat{G}$ operator in the second
term, we find that $f$ contains a contribution of the form
\begin{equation}
  \Delta f(\mathbf{k}\rightarrow\mathbf{k}') \;\propto\; \langle \mathbf{k}'|\hat{V}|\varphi\rangle\langle\varphi|\hat{G}|\varphi\rangle\langle\varphi|\hat{V}|\mathbf{k}\rangle \;=\; \frac{\langle \mathbf{k}'|\hat{V}|\varphi\rangle \, \langle\varphi|\hat{V}|\mathbf{k}\rangle}{\displaystyle E - E_{\mathrm{res}} - i \mathrm{Im}[\,\Sigma\,]},
  \label{deltaf}
\end{equation}
where $E_{\mathrm{res}}$ is defined in Eq.~\eqref{Eres}.  At
resonance, the denominator is small and $\Delta f$ is the dominant
contribution to $f$.

It is worth noting that $\Delta f$ receives contributions from
\textit{all} terms in the Born series, not just the low-order terms.
The high-order terms describe the situations where the particle
bounces around many times inside the scatterer, before finally
escaping.

The figure below shows the energy dependence of $\Delta f$, according
to Eq.~\eqref{deltaf}:

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{resonance}  
\end{center}

\noindent
The shape of the graph of $|\Delta f|^2$ versus $E$ is a Lorentzian
curve centered at $E_{\mathrm{res}}$.  The width of the peak can be
characterized by the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM), the spacing
between the two energies where $|\Delta f|^2$ has half its maximum
value.  It can be shown that
\begin{equation}
  \delta E^{(\mathrm{FWHM})} = 2\, \big|\mathrm{Im}[\Sigma]\big|.
\end{equation}
(Note that $\mathrm{Im}[\Sigma] < 0$, as shown in the previous
section.)  Hence, the closer $\Sigma$ gets to being real (i.e., the
smaller the decay rate of the quasi-bound state), the sharper the
peak.

The phase $\mathrm{arg}[\Delta f]$ also contains useful information.
As $E$ crosses $E_{\mathrm{res}}$ from below, the phase increases by
$\pi$.  The energy range over which this phase shift occurs is $\sim
|\mathrm{Im}[\Sigma]|$.

These two signatures---peaks and phase shifts---are sought after in
numerous real-world scattering experiments.  In actual experiments,
the peaks and phase shifts are often overlaid on a ``background''
caused by non-resonant processes.  For example, the plot below was
released by the CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC),
showing a resonance peak on a large background.  This was part of the
evidence for the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs boson, in
2012.

\section{Fermi's Golden Rule}
\label{sec:goldenrule}

We have seen that the width of a resonance is determined by
$\mathrm{Im}[\Sigma]$, the imaginary part of the self energy.  In this
section, we will show that $\mathrm{Im}[\Sigma]$ represents the decay
rate of a quasi-bound state, and that it can often be approximated
using a simple formula called \textbf{Fermi's Golden Rule}.

Suppose we set the state of a particle to a quasi-bound state
$|\varphi\rangle$ at time $t = 0$.  Since $|\varphi\rangle$ is not an
exact eigenstate of the Hamiltonian, the particle will not remain in
that state for $t > 0$.  Over time, the wavefunction will leak out of
the potential well, corresponding to the ``decay'' of the quasi-bound
state into the free state continuum.

The decay process can be described by
\begin{equation}
  P(t) = \Big|\langle\varphi|\exp\left(-i\hat{H}t/\hbar\right)|\varphi\rangle\Big|^2,
\end{equation}
which is the probability for the system to continue occupying state
$|\varphi\rangle$ after time $t$.  To calculate $P(t)$, let us define
the function
\begin{equation}
  f(t) = \begin{cases} \langle\varphi|\exp\left(-i\hat{H}t/\hbar\right)|\varphi\rangle \,e^{-\varepsilon t}, & t \ge 0 \\ 0, & t < 0,\end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $\varepsilon \in \mathbb{R}^+$.  For $t \ge 0$ and $\varepsilon
\rightarrow 0^+$, we see that $|f(t)|^2 \rightarrow P(t)$.  The reason
we deal with $f(t)$ is that it is more well-behaved than the actual
amplitude $\langle\varphi|\exp(-i\hat{H}t/\hbar)|\varphi\rangle$.  The
function is designed so that firstly, it vanishes at negative times
prior to start of our thought experiment; and secondly, it vanishes as
$t\rightarrow\infty$ due to the ``regulator'' $\varepsilon$.  The
latter enforces the idea that the bound state decays permanently into
the continuum of free states, and is never repopulated by waves
``bouncing back'' from infinity.

We can determine $f(t)$ by first studying its Fourier transform,
\begin{equation}
  F(\omega) \;=\; \int_{-\infty}^\infty dt \; e^{i\omega t}\, f(t) \;=\; \int_0^\infty dt \; e^{i(\omega + i\varepsilon) t} \; \langle\varphi|e^{-i\hat{H}t/\hbar}|\varphi\rangle.
\end{equation}
Now insert a resolution of the identity, $\hat{I} = \sum_n
|n\rangle\langle n|$, where $\{|n\rangle\}$ denotes the exact
eigenstates of $\hat{H}$ (for free states, the sum goes to an integral
in the usual way):
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned}F(\omega) &= \int_0^\infty dt \; e^{i(\omega + i\varepsilon) t} \; \sum_n \langle\varphi|e^{-i\hat{H}t/\hbar}|n\rangle\langle n|\varphi\rangle \\ &= \sum_n \langle\varphi|n\rangle \left( \int_0^\infty dt \; \exp\left[i\left(\omega - \frac{E_n}{\hbar} + i\varepsilon\right) t\right] \right) \langle n|\varphi\rangle \\ &= \sum_n \langle\varphi|n\rangle \frac{i}{\omega - \frac{E_n}{\hbar} + i \varepsilon} \langle n|\varphi\rangle \\ &= i \hbar\; \langle \varphi | \left(\hbar\omega - \hat{H} + i\hbar\varepsilon \right)^{\!-1} | \varphi\rangle. \end{aligned}
\end{align}
In the third line, the regulator $\varepsilon$ removes the
contribution from the $t \rightarrow\infty$ limit, as desired.  Hence,
we obtain
\begin{equation}
  \lim_{\varepsilon \rightarrow 0^+} F(\omega) = i \hbar \, \langle \varphi | \hat{G}(\hbar\omega) | \varphi\rangle,
\end{equation}
where $\hat{G}$ is our old friend the causal Green's function.  The
fact that the \textit{causal} Green's function shows up is due to our
definition of $f(t)$, which is non-vanishing only for $t \ge 0$.

As discussed in the previous section, when the resonance condition is
satisfied,
\begin{equation}
  \langle\varphi|\,\hat{G}(E)\,|\varphi\rangle \approx \frac{1}{\displaystyle E - E_{\mathrm{res}} - i \mathrm{Im}[\Sigma]},
\end{equation}
where $E_{\mathrm{res}}$ is the resonance energy and $\Sigma$ is the
self energy of the quasi-bound state.





Due to the delta function, non-vanishing contributions come only from
values of $k$ such that $E = E_k$.  We can use this fact to further
simplify the result.  Consider the first term in the sum in
Eq.~\eqref{fermigr1}, $\big| \langle\psi_k|
\hat{V}_1|\varphi\rangle\big|^2$.  It is $k$-dependent, but we can let
\begin{equation*}
  \overline{\big| \langle\psi_{k(E)}| \hat{V}_1|\varphi\rangle\big|^2}
\end{equation*}
denote its average value over the values of $k$ for which $E = E_k$.
Then we can approximate Eq.~\eqref{fermigr1} by pulling that term out
of the sum:
\begin{equation}
  \mathrm{Im}\big[\Sigma(E)\big]
  \approx - \pi \;
  \overline{\big| \langle\psi_{k(E)}| \hat{V}_1|\varphi\rangle\big|^2}
  \; \left( \sum_k \; \delta(E-E_k) \right).
  \label{fermigr2}
\end{equation}









We can now perform the
inverse Fourier transform
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned} \lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow 0^+} f(t) &= \lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow 0^+} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{d\omega}{2\pi} \; e^{-i\omega t} \, F(\omega) \\ &= \frac{i}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} d\omega\; \frac{e^{-i\omega t}}{\omega - (E_{\mathrm{res}}+i \mathrm{Im}[\Sigma])/\hbar}\\ &= \exp\left(-\frac{iE_{\mathrm{res}}t}{\hbar}\right)\, \exp\left(-\frac{|\mathrm{Im}[\Sigma]|}{\hbar}\,t\right). \end{aligned}
\end{align}
In deriving the last line, we performed a contour integration assuming
that $\mathrm{Im}[\Sigma] < 0$; this assumption will be proven
shortly.  The final result is
\begin{equation}
  P(t) = e^{-\kappa t}, \;\;\;\mathrm{where}\;\;\kappa = \frac{2|\mathrm{Im}[\Sigma]|}{\hbar}.
\end{equation}









Hence, the quasi-bound state's decay rate is
\begin{framed}
  \begin{equation}
    \kappa
    \,\approx\, \frac{2\pi}{\hbar} \;
    \big|W(E_\mathrm{res})\big|^2 \; \rho(E_{\mathrm{res}}),
    \quad \mathrm{where} \quad \left\{
    \begin{aligned}
      \big|W(E)\big|^2
      &= \overline{\Big| \langle\psi_{k(E)}| \hat{V}_1|\varphi\rangle\Big|^2} \\
      \rho(E) &= \sum_k \; \delta(E-E_k).
    \end{aligned}\right.
    \label{FGR}
  \end{equation}
\end{framed}
\vskip -0.12in
This result is called \textbf{Fermi's golden rule}.  It states that
the decay rate of a quasi-bound state is directly proportional to two
factors.  The first factor, $|W(E_\mathrm{res})|^2$, describes the
strength of the coupling between the quasi-bound state and the free
states.  It is computed from $\langle\psi_{k}|
\hat{V}_1|\varphi\rangle$, which called the \textbf{transition
  amplitude}, using free states meeting the resonance condition $E_k =
E_{\mathrm{res}}$; the stronger the coupling, the faster the decay.
The second factor, $\rho(E_{\mathrm{res}})$, is the number of free
states per unit energy at energy $E_{\mathrm{res}}$; the more free
states available, the faster the decay.

Often, these two factors are estimated using further approximations.
One common trick is to treat the free states as plane waves (we will
see an example in the next section).

When using plane waves to approximate $\{|\psi_k\rangle\}$, the $k$
labels are $d$-dimensional wave-vectors.  In this case, it is
convenient to amend Eq.~\eqref{FGR} to treat $k$-space as a continuum,
following the procedure discussed in Section 1.2: we introduce a
$k$-space discretization $dk = 2\pi/L$, where $L$ is the system size
in each direction; then, as $L\rightarrow \infty$, the discrete sum
$\sum_k$ appearing in the definition $\rho(E)$ in Eq.~\eqref{FGR} can
be turned into an integral.  In place of $\rho(E)$, we can define the
\textbf{density of states}
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{D}(E) = \int \frac{d^d k}{(2\pi)^d} \; \delta(E - E_k),
\end{equation}
which counts the number of free states with energy $E$ per unit energy
and per unit volume.

After converting the sum to an integral, there is an inverse factor
$\left[d^dk/(2\pi)^d\right]^{-1} = L^{d}$ left over, which has to be
grouped with the $|W|^2$ term in Eq.~\eqref{FGR}.  At the same time,
we have to re-normalize the free states in the definition of $|W|^2$.
If we follow the delta normalization convention from Section 1.2,
\begin{equation}
  |\psi_k\rangle^{(\textrm{new})}
  = \left(\frac{L}{2\pi}\right)^{d/2} |\psi_{k}\rangle^{(\textrm{old})},
\end{equation}
then Fermi's golden rule is re-expressed as
\begin{framed}
  \begin{equation}
    \kappa
    \,\approx\, \frac{2\pi}{\hbar} \;
    \big|\mathcal{W}(E_\mathrm{res})\big|^2 \; \mathcal{D}(E_{\mathrm{res}}),
    \quad \mathrm{where} \quad \left\{
    \begin{aligned}
      \big|\mathcal{W}(E)\big|^2
      &= (2\pi)^d \;
      \overline{\Big| \langle\psi_{k(E)}| \hat{V}_1|\varphi\rangle\Big|^2} \\
      \mathcal{D}(E) &= \int \frac{d^dk}{(2\pi)^d} \; \delta(E-E_k).
    \end{aligned}\right.
    \label{FGR2}
  \end{equation}
\end{framed}

\section{Fermi's golden rule in a 1D model}
\label{sec:fgr1d}

Let us apply Fermi's golden rule to the simple 1D model of
Section~\ref{sec:resonances}.  The potential is
\begin{equation}
  V(x) = V_0(x) + V_1(x), \;\;\;\mathrm{where}\;\;
  \left\{\;\;
  \begin{aligned}
    V_0(x) &= -U \, \Theta(a-|x|) \\
    V_1(x) &= \;\;V_b\; \Theta(b-|x|) \\
    0 &<U<V_b.
  \end{aligned}\right.
\end{equation}
The finite square well $V_0(x)$ supports one or more bound states; for
simplicity, we focus on the ground state, whose energy is denoted by
$E_0$ (where $-U < E_0 < 0$).  Its wavefunction is
\begin{equation}
  \varphi(x) = \begin{cases}\mathcal{A}\,\cos(qx), & |x| < a \\
    \mathcal{B} \, \exp\left(-\eta|x|\right), & |x| \ge a,\end{cases}
  \label{varphiansatz0}
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ are constants to be determined,
and
\begin{equation}
  q = \sqrt{\frac{2m}{\hbar^2}(E_0+U)}, \;\; \eta = \sqrt{\frac{2m}{\hbar^2}|E_0|}.
\end{equation}
By matching $\varphi(x)$ and $d\varphi/dx$ across the $x=a$ interface,
we can derive $E_0$, $\mathcal{A}$, and $\mathcal{B}$.  The details
are left as an \hyperref[ex:1dfgr]{exercise}.

Once we have obtained $\varphi(x)$, we want to use it to find the
transition amplitude $\langle\psi_k|\hat{V}_1|\varphi\rangle$, where
$\psi_k(x)$ is a ``representative'' free eigenstate of $V_0(x)$ that
the quasi-bound state decays to.  We can estimate this with a series
of tricks.  First,
\begin{equation}
  \langle\psi_k|\hat{V}_1|\varphi\rangle \,=\, \int_{-\infty}^\infty dx \, \psi_k^*(x)\, V_1(x)\, \varphi(x) \,=\, V_b \int_{-b}^b dx \; \psi_k^*(x) \,\varphi(x).
\end{equation}
Next, because $\psi_k(x)$ and $\varphi(x)$ are orthogonal,
\begin{equation}
  \int_{-\infty}^\infty dx \; \psi_k^*(x) \,\varphi(x) = 0
  \;\;\;\Rightarrow \;\;\;  
  \int_{-b}^b dx \; \psi_k^*(x) \,\varphi(x) = - \int_{|x| > b} dx \; \psi_k^*(x) \,\varphi(x).
\end{equation}
The integral breaks into two pieces, which can be interpreted as the
contribution from the quasi-bound state escaping to the left or to the
right.  We assume these contribute equally to the escape probability,
so that
\begin{equation}
  \big| \langle\psi_k|\hat{V}_1|\varphi\rangle \big|^2
  \;\approx\; 2 V_b^2 \;
  \left| \int_{b}^\infty dx \, \psi_k^*(x)\, \varphi(x)\right|^2.
  \label{overlapintegral}
\end{equation}
Outside the scatterer ($x > b$), the escaping free state can be
approximated as an outgoing plane wave, with the delta-normalized form
\begin{equation}
  \psi_k(x) \,\approx\, \frac{e^{ikx}}{\sqrt{2\pi}},
  \label{psikx}
\end{equation}
where $k$ is chosen such that
\begin{equation}
  E_k = E_{\mathrm{res}} \approx E_0 + V_b \;\;\;\Rightarrow \;\;\; k \approx \sqrt{\frac{2m}{\hbar^2}(E_0+V_b)}.
\end{equation}
Plugging Eqs.~\eqref{varphiansatz0} and \eqref{psikx} into
Eq.~\eqref{overlapintegral}, and solving the integral, gives
\begin{equation}
  \big| \langle\psi_k|\hat{V}_1|\varphi\rangle \big|^2
  \;\approx \; \frac{1}{\pi}\, V_b^2 \, \mathcal{B}^2\,
  \frac{e^{-2\eta b}}{k^2 + \eta^2}.
  \label{overlap1d}
\end{equation}

The other quantity we need for Fermi's golden rule is the density of
free states.  This can be found by taking $E_k \approx \hbar^2k^2/2m$,
and performing a change of variables:
\begin{align}
  \mathcal{D}(E)
  &= \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{dk}{2\pi} \; \delta\left(E-\frac{\hbar^2k^2}{2m}\right) \\
  &= 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_0^\infty dE' \, \frac{dk}{dE'} \, \delta(E-E') \label{dos1d_0} \\
  &= \sqrt{\frac{m}{2\pi^2\hbar^2 E}}.
  \label{dos1d}
\end{align}
In Eq.~\eqref{dos1d_0}, the factor of 2 accounts for the fact that for
each $E$, both positive and negative $k$ contribute to the density of
states.

We can now plug Eqs.~\eqref{overlap1d} and \eqref{dos1d} into Fermi's
golden rule, Eq.~\eqref{FGR2}.  In the figure below, the orange curve
shows how the resulting decay rate, $\kappa$, varies with the barrier
thickness $b-a$, with the other model parameters fixed at $U = 6$,
$V_b = 30$, and $a = 1$:

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{goldenrule}
\end{figure}

\noindent
For comparison, the blue dots show the values of $\kappa$ taken from
the width of the resonant scattering peak (see
Section~\ref{sec:green_resonances}).  For this calculation, we use the
transfer matrix method to compute the $E$-dependent transmittance for
particles incident on one side of the scatterer (see Appendix B), and
numerically extract the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) for the peak
near $E_{\mathrm{res}}$.

Evidently, Fermi's golden rule (the orange curve) gives a very good
estimate for the true decay rate based on the scattering peak width
(the blue dots).  The agreement is not exact, but after all the
Fermi's golden rule result is based on a series of approximations,
including the various assumptions in the derivation of Fermi's golden
rule (discussed in Sections~\ref{sec:green_resonances} and
\ref{sec:goldenrule}), as well as the approximations used in applying
Fermi's golden rule (e.g., using plane waves to calculate the
transition amplitude and density of states).

In this simple 1D example, it takes more or less the same amount of
effort to estimate the decay rate from Fermi's golden rule or
calculate it exactly.  However, in other situations, such as
higher-dimensional systems, the true decay rate may be very hard to
compute, and Fermi's golden rule becomes valuable since it is both
accurate and easy to calculate.

\section*{Exercises}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Use the variational theorem to prove that a 1D potential well
  has at least one bound state.  Assume that the potential $V(x)$
  satisfies (i) $V(x) < 0$ for all $x$, and (ii) $V(x)\rightarrow 0$
  for $x\rightarrow\pm\infty$.  The Hamiltonian is
  \begin{equation}
    \hat{H} = - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{d^2}{dx^2} + V(x).
  \end{equation}
  Consider a (real) trial wavefunction
  \begin{equation}
    \psi(x;\gamma) = \left(\frac{2\gamma}{\pi}\right)^{1/4} \,e^{-\gamma x^2}.
  \end{equation}
  Note that this can be shown to be normalized to unity, using Gauss'
  integral
  \begin{equation}
    \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} dx\; e^{-2\gamma x^2} = \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2\gamma}}.
  \end{equation}
  Now prove that
  \begin{align}
    \begin{aligned}
      \langle E \rangle &= \int_{-\infty}^\infty dx \; \psi(x) \, \hat{H} \,\psi(x) \\
      &= \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \int_{-\infty}^\infty dx\, \left(\frac{d\psi}{dx}\right)^2
      \;+\; \int_{-\infty}^\infty dx\; V(x) \,\psi^2(x) \\
      &= A\sqrt{\gamma} \left[\sqrt{\gamma}
        \;+\, B \int_{-\infty}^\infty dx\; V(x) \;e^{-\gamma x^2}
        \right],
    \end{aligned}
  \end{align}
  where $A$ and $B$ are positive real constants to be determined.  By
  looking at the quantity in square brackets in the limit $\gamma
  \rightarrow 0$, argue that $\langle E \rangle < 0$ in this limit.
  Hence, explain why this implies the existence of a bound state.

  Finally, try generalizing this approach to the case of a 2D
  radially-symmetric potential well $V(x,y) = V(r)$, where $r =
  \sqrt{x^2+y^2}$.  Identify which part of the argument fails in 2D.
       [For a discussion of certain 2D potential wells that
         \textit{do} always support bounds states, similar to 1D
         potential wells, see Ref.~[\ref{cite:simon}].]
  \label{ex:boundstate}

\item In this problem, you will investigate the existence of bound
  states in a 3D potential well that is finite, uniform, and
  spherically-symmetric.  The potential function is
  \begin{equation}
    V(r,\theta,\phi) = -U\Theta(a-r),
  \end{equation}
  where $a$ is the radius of the spherical well, $U$ is the depth,
  and $(r,\theta,\phi)$ are spherical coordinates defined in the usual
  way.

  The solution involves a variant of the partial wave analysis
  discussed in Appendix A.  For $E < 0$, the Schr\"odinger equation
  reduces to
  \begin{equation}
    \begin{cases}\Big(\nabla^2 + q^2\Big) \psi(r,\theta,\phi) = 0 \;\;\mathrm{where}\;\; q = \sqrt{2m(E+U)/\hbar^2}, \;\;&\mathrm{for} \; r \le a \\ \Big(\nabla^2 - \gamma^2\Big) \psi(r,\theta,\phi) = 0 \;\;\mathrm{where}\;\; \gamma = \sqrt{-2mE/\hbar^2}, \;\;&\mathrm{for} \; r \ge a. \end{cases}
  \end{equation}
  For the first equation (called the Helmholtz equation), we seek
  solutions of the form
  \begin{equation}
    \psi(r,\theta,\phi) = f(r) \, Y_{\ell m}(\theta,\phi),
  \end{equation}
  where $Y_{\ell m}(\theta,\phi)$ are
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_harmonics}{spherical
    harmonics}, and the integers $l$ and $m$ are angular momentum
  quantum numbers satisfying $l \ge 0$ and $-l \le m \le l$.
  Substituting into the Helmholtz equation yields
  \begin{equation}
    r^2\frac{d^2f}{dr^2} + 2r \frac{df}{dr}+\left[q^2r^2-l(l+1)\right] f(r) = 0,
  \end{equation}
  which is the \textbf{spherical Bessel equation}.  The solutions to
  this equation that are non-divergent at $r = 0$ are $f(r) =
  j_\ell(qr)$, where $j_\ell$ is called a \textbf{spherical Bessel function
    of the first kind}.  Most numerical packages provide functions to
  calculate these (e.g.,
  \href{https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.special.spherical_jn.html}{\texttt{scipy.special.spherical\_jn}}
  in \href{https://scipy.org/}{Scientific Python}).

  Similarly, solutions for the second equation can be written as
  $\psi(r,\theta,\phi) = g(r) \, Y_{\ell m}(\theta,\phi),$ yielding an
  equation for $g(r)$ called the \textbf{modified spherical Bessel
    equation}.  The solutions which do not diverge as $r\rightarrow
  \infty$ are $g(r) = k_\ell(\gamma r)$, where $k_\ell$ is called a
  \textbf{modified spherical Bessel function of the second kind}.
  Again, this can be computed numerically (e.g., using
  \href{https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.special.spherical_kn.html#scipy.special.spherical_kn}{\texttt{scipy.special.spherical\_kn}}
  in Scientific Python).

  Using the above facts, show that the condition for a bound state to
  exist is
  \begin{equation}
    \frac{qj_\ell'(qa)}{j_\ell(qa)} = \frac{\gamma k_\ell'(\gamma a)}{k_\ell(\gamma a)},
  \end{equation}
  where $j_\ell'$ and $k_\ell'$ denote the derivatives of the relevant
  special functions, and $q$ and $\gamma$ depend on $E$ and $U$ as
  described above.  Write a program to search for the bound state
  energies at any given $a$ and $U$, and hence determine the
  conditions under which the potential does not support bound
  states.
\label{ex:boundstate3d}

\item
  \label{ex:1dfgr}
  In this problem, we will find the quasi-bound and free states for
  the model discussed in Section~\ref{sec:fgr1d}, and use it to
  calculate the decay rate according to Fermi's golden rule.

  Let $\varphi(x)$ be the bound state of a square well of width $2a$
  and depth $U$, and let $E_0$ be the energy.  This state satisfies
  the 1D time-independent Schr\"odinger wave equation,
  \begin{equation}
    \left[- \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{d^2}{dx^2} + V(x)\right] \varphi(x)
    = E_0\, \varphi(x),
    \label{tise1d}
  \end{equation}
  where
  \begin{equation}
    V(x) = V_0(x) + V_1(x), \;\;\;\mathrm{where}\;\;
    \left\{\;\;
    \begin{aligned}
      V_0(x) &= -U \, \Theta(a-|x|) \\
      V_1(x) &= \;\;V_b\; \Theta(b-|x|) \\
      0 &<U<V_b.
    \end{aligned}\right.
    \label{vx}
  \end{equation}
  Take the ansatz
  \begin{equation}
    \varphi(x) = \begin{cases}\mathcal{A}\,\cos(qx), & |x| < a \\
      \mathcal{B} \, \exp\left(-\eta|x|\right), & |x| \ge a.\end{cases}
    \label{varphiansatz}
  \end{equation}

  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item Using Eqs.~\eqref{tise1d}--\eqref{varphiansatz}, and the fact
    that both $\varphi(x)$ and $d\varphi/dx$ are continuous at $x =
    \pm a$, prove that $E_0$ can be obtained by solving the
    transcendental equation
    \begin{align}
      q \tan(qa) = \eta, \;\;\;\mathrm{where}\;\;
      \left\{\;
      \begin{aligned}
        q &= \sqrt{\frac{2m}{\hbar^2}(E_0+U)} \\
        \eta &= \sqrt{\frac{2m}{\hbar^2}|E_0|}.
      \end{aligned}\right.
      \label{qtanqa}
    \end{align}
  
  \item By using the fact that $\varphi(x)$ is normalized to unity,
    prove that
  \begin{equation}
  \mathcal{B}^2 = \frac{\exp\big(2\eta a\big)}{a} \left[\frac{1+\sin(2qa)/2qa}{\cos^2(qa)}+\frac{1}{\eta a}\right]^{-1}.
  \label{Bresult}
  \end{equation}

\item Write a program to compute the decay rate based on Fermi's
  golden rule, by combining Eqs.~\eqref{FGR2}, \eqref{overlap1d},
  \eqref{dos1d}, \eqref{qtanqa}, and \eqref{Bresult}.  Hence,
  reproduce the plot shown in Section~\ref{sec:fgr1d}.

\item Write a program to extract the decay rate from the width of the
  transmission peak, using the transfer matrix method (see Appendix
  B).  Hence, investigate the accuracy of the Fermi's golden rule
  result for different values of $U$, $V_b$, and the other model
  parameters.

%% For decades after the discovery of quantum mechanics, the quantum
%% double-slit experiment was just a ``thought experiment'', meant to
%% illustrate the features of quantum mechanics that had been uncovered
%% by other, more complicated experiments.  Nowadays, the most convenient
%% way to do the experiment is with light, using single-photon sources
%% and single-photon detectors.  Quantum interference has also been
%% demonstrated experimentally using electrons, neutrons, and even
%% large-scale particles such as buckyballs.
