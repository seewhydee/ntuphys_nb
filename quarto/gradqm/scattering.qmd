# Scattering Theory

## The double-slit experiment

A famous property of quantum mechanical particles is **wave-particle
duality**, whose essential features can be succinctly described via
the following thought experiment:

Suppose a source emits electrons of energy $E \in \mathbb{R}^+$ toward
a screen with a pair of slits, as shown below.  A movable detector,
placed on the far side, measures the arrival rates at different
positions.

![](fig/doubleslit.png){fig-align="center" width="500" fig-alt="Schematic of a double-slit experiment"}

Were we to perform such an experiment, we would observe the following:

1. The electrons arrive in discrete units, similar to classical
   particles;

2. Yet the *statistical* distribution of the electron arrivals forms
   an interference pattern, like a wave undergoing diffraction.  In
   the non-relativistic limit, the inferred wavelength $\lambda$ is
   related to the electron energy $E$ by
$$\lambda = \frac{2\pi}{k}, \;\;\; E = \frac{\hbar^2k^2}{2m},$$
where $m$ is the electron mass.  As a corollary, if $E$ is
known, we can use this interference pattern to deduce the spacing of
the slits.

In this chapter, we will study a generalization of the double-slit
experiment called a **scattering experiment**.  The idea is to shoot
quantum particles at a target, called a **scatterer**, and measure the
distribution of scattered particles.  Just as the double-slit
interference pattern can be used to deduce the slit spacing, we can
use a scattering experiment to learn things about the scatterer.  In
fact, scattering experiments constitute a large proportion of the
methods that are used to probe the quantum world, from electron- and
photon-based microscopy to accelerator experiments in high-energy
physics.

## The scattering problem

The figure below depicts the kind of scattering experiment we
intend to study:

![](fig/scattering.png){fig-align="center" width="500" fig-alt="Schematic of a scattering experiment"}

In an unbounded $d$-dimensional space (typically, we will have $d=3$,
but let us keep our options open), there is an object called a
scatterer.  Without loss of generality, we assume the scatterer is
placed near the coordinate origin, $\mathbf{r} = 0$.  We now shoot
quantum particles of energy $E$ at the scatterer.

Let us assume that these particles do not interact with each other, in
which case we can just analyze the behavior of an individual,
representative, particle.  Moreover, let us assume that (i) this
particle is non-relativistic, and (ii) the particle "sees" the
scatterer as some potential energy function $V(\mathbf{r})$, called
the **scattering potential**.  Thus, the particle is governed by the
Hamiltonian

$$\hat{H} = \hat{H}_0 + V(\hat{\mathbf{r}}), \;\;\; \hat{H}_0 = \frac{\hat{\mathbf{p}}^2}{2m},$$

where $m$ is the particle mass, and $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ and
$\hat{\mathbf{p}}$ are the position and momentum operators.  Outside
the scatterer, we assume that space is empty, so the potential
function vanishes at large distances:

$$V(\mathbf{r}) \; \overset{|\mathbf{r}| \rightarrow \infty}{\longrightarrow}\; 0.$$

Next up, we need to formulate the mathematical problem whose solution
will describe how the incident particle is affected by the scatterer.
Let us state the formulation first, before elaborating on its meaning
later.

### Formulation of the scattering problem{#sec-scattering-formulation}

1. Define a particle state $|\psi\rangle$, called the **total state**, that obeys the time-independent Schrödinger equation
$$\hat{H} |\psi\rangle = E |\psi\rangle,$$
where $E \in \mathbb{R}^+$ is the incoming particle energy.

2. The total state $|\psi\rangle$ can be decomposed into two pieces,
$$|\psi\rangle \,=\, |\psi_i\rangle \,+\, |\psi_s\rangle,$$
where $|\psi_i\rangle$ is called the **incident state** and
$|\psi_s\rangle$ is called the **scattered state**.

3. The incident state is described by a plane wave, which is a
simultaneous eigenstate of $\hat{H}_0$ and $\hat{\mathbf{p}}$:
$$\begin{cases}
\hat{H}_0 |\psi_i\rangle &= \, E |\psi_i\rangle, \\
\;\;\hat{\mathbf{p}} |\psi_i\rangle &= \, \mathbf{p}_i |\psi_i\rangle,
\end{cases}
\quad \mathrm{where} \;\;\; E = \frac{|\mathbf{p}_i|^2}{2m}.
\label{scatter3}
$$

4. The scattered state is an "outgoing" state.  The meaning of this is
a little subtle, so let us fill in this part later.

We can interpret the above statements as follows.  Statement 1 says
the scattering is elastic: the scatterer is described by a potential
$V(\mathbf{r})$, so its interaction with the particle is
energy-conserving and occurs with a fixed value of $E$.  Statement 2
says that the total wavefunction
$\psi(\mathbf{r}) = \langle \mathbf{r} |\psi\rangle$
is a superposition of an incoming wave and a scattered wave.
Statement 3 defines the incoming wave as a plane wave with a fixed
wavelength (determined by $E$).  Statement 4 says the scattered wave
moves outward to infinity, away from the scatterer (what this means,
in practice, will become clearer later on).

Note that Statements 1--4 do *not* define an eigenproblem!  Usually,
we deal with the time-independent Schröodinger equation by finding
eigenvalues and eigenstates.  But here we are given $|\psi_i\rangle$,
$E$, and $V(\mathbf{r})$, and want $|\psi_s\rangle$.  In particular,
$E$ is an input to the calculation (a continuously variable
parameter), not an output (an eigenvalue).

## Scattering from a 1D delta function potential {#sec-1d-scattering}

We are now ready to solve a simple scattering problem.  Consider a 1D
space with spatial coordinate $x$, and a scattering potential
consisting of a "spike" at $x = 0$:

$$V(x) = \frac{\hbar^2\gamma}{2m} \,\delta(x).$$

The form of the prefactor $\hbar^2\gamma/2m$ is chosen for later
convenience; the parameter $\gamma$, which has units of $[1/x]$,
controls the strength of the scattering potential.

![](fig/scattering1d.png){fig-align="center" width="500" fig-alt="Setup for scattering from a 1D delta function potential"}

The particle wavefunction $\psi(x)$ satisfies the 1D Schrödinger
wave equation

$$\left[-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{d^2}{dx^2} + \frac{\hbar^2\gamma}{2m} \,\delta(x) \right] \psi(x) = E \psi(x).$$

We can tidy this up by multipling both sides by $2m/\hbar^2$, and defining $k = \sqrt{2mE/\hbar^2} \in \mathbb{R}^+$:

$$\left[- \frac{d^2}{dx^2} + \gamma \,\delta(x) \right] \psi(x) = k^2 \psi(x).$${#eq-scattering-1d}

This is a second-order ordinary differential equation, which normally
requires $\psi(x)$ to have a well-defined second derivative, which in
turn implies that its first derivative is continuous.  However,
because the delta function potential is singular at $x = 0$, this
requirement is modified: at this point (and only this point),
$\psi(x)$ may have a discontinuous first derivative (which makes the
second derivative singular).  Specifically, let us integrate
@eq-scattering-1d over an infinitesimal range around $x = 0$:

$$\begin{aligned}\lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow 0^+} \int_{-\varepsilon}^{+\varepsilon} dx\; \left[- \frac{d^2}{dx^2} + \gamma \delta(x)\right] \psi(x) &= \lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow 0^+} \int_{-\varepsilon}^{+\varepsilon} dx\; k^2 \psi(x) \\ = \lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow 0^+} \left(- \left[\frac{d\psi}{dx}\right]_{-\varepsilon}^{+\varepsilon} \right) + \gamma \psi(0) &= 0.
\end{aligned}$$

Note that the right-hand side vanishes because the integration occurs
over an infinitestimal interval, whereas the integrand is finite.
Therefore, we find that

$$\lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow 0^+} \left(\; \left.\frac{d\psi}{dx}\right|_{x = +\varepsilon} - \;\; \left.\frac{d\psi}{dx}\right|_{x = -\varepsilon}\; \right) =  \gamma \,\psi(0).$$

Next, we follow the formulation of the scattering problem
(@sec-scattering-formulation), and split the total wavefunction into
an incident part and a scattering part:

$$\psi(x) = \psi_i(x) + \psi_s(x).$$

The incident part should be a plane wave, which corresponds to a
momentum eigenstate.  However, *we will normalize it in a special
way*, instead of choosing the usual prefactor corresponding to
delta-normalization.  Let us define

$$\psi_i(x) = \Psi_i \, e^{ik x},$${#eq-planar-1d}

where $\Psi_i \in \mathbb{C}$ is called the **incident amplitude**,
which controls the magnitude and phase of the incident wavefunction,
while $k$ is the usual wavenumber (determined by $E$).  In this way,
@eq-scattering-1d reduces to

$$\left[- \frac{d^2}{dx^2} + \gamma \delta(x)\right] \Big(\Psi_i \, e^{ikx} + \psi_s(x) \Big) = k^2 \Big(\Psi_i \, e^{ikx} + \psi_s(x) \Big).$$

After cancelling a pair of equal terms and shuffling the rest around,
this simplifies to

$$\left[ \frac{d^2}{dx^2} + k^2\right] \psi_s(x) = \gamma \delta(x) \Big(\Psi_i \, e^{ikx} + \psi_s(x) \Big).$${#eq-scattering-1d-2}

We can construct the solution by separately considering the regions $x
< 0$ and $x > 0$.  In each half-space, $\delta(x)$ vanishes and
@eq-scattering-1d-2 reduces to the Helmholtz equation

$$\left[\frac{d^2}{dx^2} + k^2\right] \psi_s(x) = 0\;\;\; (x \ne 0).$$

This has the general solution

$$\psi_s(x) = \Psi_i \left(f_R \, e^{ik x} + f_L \, e^{-ik x}\right),$$

which is a superposition of a right-moving with complex amplitude
$f_R$, and a left-moving wave with complex amplitude $f_L$.  Note,
however, that these amplitudes may have different values in the two
distinct half-spaces.  According to our formulation of the scattering
problem (@sec-scattering-formulation), the scattered wave should be
*outgoing*.  Therefore, we specify that for $x < 0$, $\psi_s$ is
purely left-moving, whereas for $x > 0$ it is purely right-moving:

$$\psi_s(x) = \Psi_i \times \begin{cases}f_- \,e^{-ikx}, & x < 0 \\ f_+ \,e^{ikx}, & x > 0.\end{cases}$$

The parameters $f_-, f_+ \in \mathbb{C}$ describe the magnitude and
phase of the outgoing wavefunction, and are called **scattering
amplitudes**.

Furthermore, $\psi(x)$ should be continuous at $x = 0$,^[This is
because $\psi(x)$ is a solution to a second-order ordinary
differential equation (ODE).  Normally, the solution must have a
well-defined second derivative everywhere (otherwise the ODE isn't
well-defined), which implies that the first derivative is well-defined
and continuous, and, in turn, $\psi(x)$ is continuous.  As we've seen,
in @eq-scattering-1d this condition is altered by the delta function
in the ODE: the second derivative becomes singular at $x = 0$, so the
first derivative is discontinuous.  However, the requirement that
$\psi(x)$ be continuous remains in place.] so

$$f_- = f_+ \;\;\;\Rightarrow \;\;\; \psi_s(x) = \Psi_i \,f\, e^{ik|x|}.$$

Plugging this into @eq-scattering-1d-2, and doing a bit of algebra, we
obtain

$$f = -\frac{\gamma}{\gamma - 2ik}.$$

For now, let us focus on the magnitude of the scattering amplitude (in
the next chapter, we will see that the phase also contains useful
information).  The quantity $|f|^2$ quantifies how much of the
incident wave gets scattered:

$$|f|^2 = \left[1 + \frac{8mE}{(\hbar\gamma)^2}\right]^{-1}.$$

Its dependence on $E$ is plotted below:

![](fig/scattering1df.png){fig-align="center" width="500" fig-alt="Graph of the squared scattering amplitude for scattering from a 1D delta function"}

The behavior matches our intuition.  For a given particle energy $E$,
the scattering grows stronger as the potential strength parameter
$|\gamma|$ increases.  On the other hand, for fixed $\gamma$, a
higher-energy particle undergoes less scattering.  Note also that
attractive potentials ($\gamma < 0$) and repulsive potentials ($\gamma
> 0$) are equally effective at scattering.

## Scattering amplitudes{#sec-scattering-amplitudes}

In @sec-1d-scattering, we saw that a particle in 1D can only scatter
in two possible directions: forward or backward.  In 2D and higher
spatial dimensions, however, a particle can also scatter *sideways*;
in fact, there is a continuous set of possible scattering directions.
To deal with this, we must develop a more systematic way to
characterize the scattered wave.

In $d$ spatial dimensions, we define the incident planar wavefunction
as

$$\psi_i(\mathbf{r}) = \Psi_i \, e^{i\mathbf{k}_i\cdot\mathbf{r}},
\;\;\; |\mathbf{k}_i| = k = \sqrt{\frac{2mE}{\hbar^2}}.$${#eq-psiin}

Similar to the 1D case (@eq-planar-1d), $\Psi_i \in \mathbb{C}$ is the
**incident amplitude**, describing the magnitude and phase of the
incident wave.  The incident wave-vector $\mathbf{k}_i$ can have any
orientation, but its magnitude is fixed by the energy of the particle.

What about the scattered wavefunction $\psi_s(\mathbf{r})$?  In
general, we can express its $\mathbf{r}$-dependence using some
coordinate system of the form $(r,\Omega)$, where $r = |\mathbf{r}|$
is the distance from the origin and $\Omega$ denotes a set of other
directional coordinates for the $d$-dimensional space.  For instance,

* For $d = 3$, we can use spherical coordinates $(r, \theta, \phi)$, so $\Omega = (\theta, \phi)$.

* For $d = 2$, we can use polar coordinates $(r,\phi)$, so $\Omega = \phi$.

* For $d = 1$, we can let $\Omega \in \{+, -\}$, where $+$ denotes the
rightward direction and $-$ denotes the leftward direction.

In a typical scattering experiment, the scattered wavefunction is
detected at $r \rightarrow \infty$; i.e., at distances much longer
than the size of the scatterer, the free-space wavelength, or any
other relevant length scales.  In this regime, the scattered
wavefunction should reduce to the form

$$\psi_s(\mathbf{r})\;  \overset{r\rightarrow\infty}{\longrightarrow}\; \Psi_i \, r^{\frac{1-d}{2}} \, e^{ikr} \, f(\Omega).$${#eq-scattered-wave-form}

To understand why, let us go through the individual multiplicative
factors on the right side of @eq-scattered-wave-form:

* The first factor $\Psi_i$ accounts for the fact that the Schrödinger
wave equation is linear.  If we vary the incident amplitude, the
scattered wavefunction must vary proportionally.

* The next two factors, $r^{\frac{1-d}{2}} \, e^{ikr}$, give the
$r$-dependence of a wave expanding radially from the origin.  The
$e^{ikr}$ factor describes an outgoing wave.^[The wavefunction's phase
increases along the direction of propagation, so $e^{ikr}$ means the
wave propagates in the direction of increasing $r$] The other factor
provides the $r$-scaling needed for probability conservation.  The probability current density for the scattered
wavefunction is
$$ \mathbf{J}_s = \frac{\hbar}{m} \mathrm{Im}\big[\psi_s^*\nabla\psi_s\big],$$
and the radial component of this is
$$\begin{aligned}J_{s}^r\; &= \frac{\hbar}{m}\,
\mathrm{Im}\left[\psi_s^* \frac{\partial}{\partial r}\psi_s\right] \\
&\overset{r\rightarrow\infty}{\longrightarrow}\;\, \left(\frac{\hbar}{m}\, |\Psi_i|^2\,|f|^2\right)\;
\mathrm{Im}\left[\left(r^{\frac{1-d}{2}} \, e^{ikr}\right)^* \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left(r^{\frac{1-d}{2}} \,e^{ikr}\right)\right] \\
&= \left(\frac{\hbar}{m} |\Psi_i|^2\, |f|^2\right)\; \mathrm{Im}\left[\left(r^{\frac{1-d}{2}} \, e^{ikr}\right)^* \left(ik r^{\frac{1-d}{2}} \, e^{ikr} + \frac{1-d}{2} \, r^{\frac{-1-d}{2}} \, e^{ikr}\right)\right] \\
&= \left(\frac{\hbar k}{m} \, |\Psi_i|^2 \, |f|^2\right) \, r^{1-d} \;+\;
O(r^{-d}).\end{aligned}$${#eq-psiscat-r}
In $d$ dimensions, the area of the surface at distance $r$ from the
origin scales as $r^{d-1}$; hence, $J_{s}^r$ scales inversely with
area, whereas the total flux (the area integral of $J_{s}^r$) is
independent of $r$.

* The final factor, $f(\Omega)$, is called the **scattering
amplitude**.  Since the other factors are completely determined (as we
have just seen), only the scattering amplitude depends on the specific
details of the scattering potential $V(\mathbf{r})$.  Hence, it is the
main avenue by which we can gain information from a scattering
experiment.

It is worth emphasizing that the scattering amplitude is a function of
$\Omega$, i.e., the direction of the position $\mathbf{r}$ at which we
are observing the scattered wavefunction.  We can also write it using
the notation

$$f(\mathbf{k}_i \rightarrow \mathbf{k}_f), \qquad \mathbf{k}_f = k\, \frac{\mathbf{r}}{|\mathbf{r}|}.$$

This emphasizes that the particle is initially incident with
wave-vector $\mathbf{k}_i$, then gets scattered elastically into a
wave-vector $\mathbf{k}_f$ pointing in the direction of $\mathbf{r}$.

### Scattering cross section

From the scattering amplitude, we can define two other important
quantities:

$$\begin{aligned}\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} &= \big|f(\Omega)\big|^2 \qquad\quad\quad \text{(the \textbf{differential scattering cross section})} \\ \sigma &= \int d\Omega\; \big|f(\Omega)\big|^2 \quad\; \text{(the \textbf{total scattering cross section}).}\end{aligned}$$

Here, $\int d\Omega$ denotes the integral(s) over all the angle
coordinates.  For 1D, this is replaced by a discrete sum over the
forward and backward directions, as we saw in @sec-1d-scattering.

The term "cross section" comes from an analogy with the scattering of
classical particles.  Imagine a stream of *classical* particles
incident on a "hard-body" scatterer:

![](fig/crosssection.png){fig-align="center" width="500" fig-alt="Schematic of particles incident on a hard body with cross sectional area sigma"}

Suppose these classical particles have the same flux as the incident
wavefunction we were previously considering, i.e.,

$$J_{i} = \frac{\hbar k}{m} \;|\Psi_i|^2.$${#eq-incident-flux}

Note that flux has units of $[x^{1-d}t^{-1}]$, or number per unit time
per unit area (in $d$ dimensional space).  If we assume the scatterer
only interacts with the particles striking it directly, then the rate
at which these strikes occur is

$$I_s = J_i \, \sigma,$${#eq-hard-scattering}

where $\sigma$ is the exposed cross-sectional area of the scatterer,
as shown in the figure.  This is the total rate at which scattering
occurs, regardless of where the particles scatter to.

Let us compare this to the quantum mechanical scattering rate.  In
@eq-psiscat-r, we found that the radial component of the probability
current density is

$$J_s^r \; \overset{r\rightarrow\infty}{\longrightarrow}\;
  \frac{\hbar \,k}{m}\; |\Psi_i|^2 \; |f(\Omega)|^2 \,r^{1-d}
  + O(r^{-d}).$$

The total outgoing probability current is obtained by integrating the
flux over an area of constant radius,

$$I_s = \int d\Omega\; r^{d-1} \, J_{s,r} = \left(\frac{\hbar k}{m} \;|\Psi_i|^2\right) \; \int d\Omega\; \big|f(\Omega)\big|^2.$$

On the right side, the quantity in parentheses equals the incident
flux $J_i$ (@eq-incident-flux).  Thus, this result bears the same form
as the classical hard body scattering relation, @eq-hard-scattering,
with the quantity

$$\sigma \equiv \int d\Omega \; \big|f(\Omega)\big|^2.$$

playing the role of the scatterer's cross-sectional area.  We
therefore call this the **total scattering cross section**.

Moreover, the integrand $|f|^2$ represents the rate, per unit of solid
angle, at which particles are scattered in a given direction.  We call
this the **differential scattering cross section**.  The total and
differential scattering cross sections are the principal observable
quantities typically obtained in scattering experiments.

## The Green's function

The scattering amplitude $f(\Omega)$ can be calculated using a variety
of analytical and numerical methods.  We will discuss one particularly
important approach, based on a quantum variant of the Green's function
technique for solving inhomogenous differential equations.

Let us return to the formulation of the scattering problem
(@sec-scattering-formulation), which consists of the equations
$$\begin{aligned} \hat{H} &= \hat{H}_0+\hat{V} \\ \hat{H} |\psi\rangle &= E |\psi\rangle \\ |\psi\rangle &= |\psi_i\rangle \,+\, |\psi_s\rangle \\ \hat{H}_0 |\psi_i\rangle &= E |\psi_i\rangle.\end{aligned}$$

These can be combined as follows:

$$\begin{aligned}
  \left(\hat{H}_0 + \hat{V}\right) |\psi_i\rangle + \hat{H} |\psi_s\rangle &= E \left( |\psi_i\rangle + |\psi_s\rangle \right) \\
  \Rightarrow \quad \hat{V} |\psi_i\rangle + \hat{H} |\psi_s\rangle &= E |\psi_s\rangle  \\
  \Rightarrow \quad\; \left(E - \hat{H}\right) |\psi_s\rangle & = \hat{V} |\psi_i\rangle \end{aligned}$${#eq-E-H-psis}

To proceed, let us define an operator called the **Green's function**:

$$\hat{G}(E) = \big(E-\hat{H}\big)^{-1}.$$

Note that $\hat{G}(E)$ depends parametrically on $E$.  Using this, we
can convert @eq-E-H-psis into

$$|\psi_s\rangle = \hat{G} \hat{V} |\psi_i\rangle.$${#eq-scatterform}

It will also be useful to define the Green's function for a free
particle,

$$\hat{G}_0(E)=\big(E-\hat{H}_0\big)^{-1}.$${#eq-G0-unregulated}

As we shall see, it is often the case that $\hat{G}_0$ can be
calculated exactly, whereas $\hat{G}$ has no closed-form analytic
expression.  We can now relate $G$ and $G_0$ as follows:

$$\begin{aligned}
\hat{G}(E-\hat{H}_0 - \hat{V})\;\; &= I \;\;\;\mathrm{and}\;\; (E-\hat{H}_0 - \hat{V})\hat{G} = I \\ \Leftrightarrow \quad\qquad \hat{G} \hat{G}_0^{-1} - \hat{G}\hat{V} &= I \;\;\; \mathrm{and}\;\;\;\;\, \hat{G}_0^{-1} \hat{G} - \hat{V}\hat{G} \;\;\;= I.
\end{aligned}$$

Upon respectively right-multiplying and left-multiplying these equations
by $\hat{G}_0$, we arrive at the following pair of equations, called
**Dyson's equations**:

$$\begin{aligned}
\hat{G} \;&= \; \hat{G}_0 + \hat{G}\hat{V}\hat{G}_0 \\
\hat{G} \;&=\; \hat{G}_0 + \hat{G}_0\hat{V}\hat{G}
\end{aligned}$${#eq-dyson}

These equations are *implicit*, as the unknown $\hat{G}$ appears on
both the left and right sides.

Applying the second Dyson equation to the scattering problem
@eq-scatterform gives

$$\begin{aligned}
|\psi_s\rangle
&= \left(\hat{G}_0 + \hat{G}_0\hat{V}\hat{G}\right) \hat{V}
\, |\psi_i\rangle \\
&= \hat{G}_0 \hat{V} \left(\hat{I} + \hat{G} \hat{V}\right) |\psi_i\rangle.\end{aligned}$${#eq-psis_useful}

Using @eq-scatterform again, we get

$$|\psi_s\rangle = \hat{G}_0\hat{V} |\psi\rangle.$$

This remains an implicit equation, but with the unknown expressed in
$|\psi\rangle$ rather than $\hat{G}$.  Note, however, that the results
up to this point have been approximation-free.

### The Born series{#sec-born-series}

One way to solving the implicit equation is to repeatedly plug its
right side back into itself:

$$\begin{aligned}
|\psi_s\rangle &= \hat{G}_0 \hat{V} \left(|\psi_i\rangle + \hat{G}_0 \hat{V}|\psi\rangle\right) \\
&= \quad \vdots \\
&= \left[\hat{G}_0 \hat{V} + (\hat{G}_0 \hat{V})^2 + (\hat{G}_0 \hat{V})^3 + \cdots\right]|\psi_i\rangle.
\end{aligned}$$

Or, equivalently,

$$|\psi\rangle
= \left[\hat{I} + \hat{G}_0 \hat{V} + (\hat{G}_0 \hat{V})^2 + (\hat{G}_0 \hat{V})^3 + \cdots\right]|\psi_i\rangle.$${#eq-bornseries}

This infinite series is called the **Born series**.  To interpret this
result, let us go to the position basis:

$$\begin{aligned}\psi(\mathbf{r}) = \psi_i(\mathbf{r}) &+ \int d^dr' \langle \mathbf{r} | \hat{G}_0 |\mathbf{r}'\rangle\, V(\mathbf{r}') \psi_i(\mathbf{r}') \\ &+ \int d^dr' d^dr'' \langle \mathbf{r} | \hat{G}_0 |\mathbf{r}'\rangle\, V(\mathbf{r}') \, \langle \mathbf{r}' | \hat{G}_0 |\mathbf{r}''\rangle \, V(\mathbf{r}'') \psi_i(\mathbf{r}'') \;\; + \;\;\cdots\end{aligned}$${#eq-born-position}

This can be regarded as a multiple-scattering process.  The
wavefunction consists of a superposition of terms involving zero, one,
two, or more scattering events, as depicted below:

![](fig/bornseries){fig-align="center" width="600" fig-alt="Schematic of the Born series as a multiple-scattering process"}

For example, the second-order term is

$$\int d^dr' d^dr'' \langle \mathbf{r} | \hat{G}_0 |\mathbf{r}'\rangle\, V(\mathbf{r}') \, \langle \mathbf{r}' | \hat{G}_0 |\mathbf{r}''\rangle \, V(\mathbf{r}'') \psi_i(\mathbf{r}''),$$

which describes the particle undergoing (i) scattering of the incident
particle at point $\mathbf{r}''$, (ii) propagation from $\mathbf{r}''$
to $\mathbf{r}'$, (iii) scattering again at point $\mathbf{r}'$, and
(iv) propagation from $\mathbf{r}'$ to $\mathbf{r}$.  Note that
$\mathbf{r}'$ and $\mathbf{r}''$ are integrated over all possible
positions.  Since the integrals are weighted by $V$, the positions
with the strongest scattering potential contribute the most.

For a sufficiently weak scatterer, it is often a good approximation to
retain just the first few terms in the Born series.  The question of
when $\hat{V}$ is "sufficiently weak"---i.e., when the Born series
converges---is a complex topic beyond the scope of our present
discussion.

### The free-particle Green's function

In the position basis representation of the Born series,
@eq-born-position, a crucial role is played by the matrix elements
$\langle\mathbf{r}|\hat{G}_0|\mathbf{r}'\rangle$.  We call this the
**propagator**, as it describes how the particle propagates between
discrete scattering events.

Starting from the definition of $\hat{G}_0$, @eq-G0-unregulated, we
can evaluate it in the position basis:

$$\begin{aligned}
\langle\mathbf{r} |\big(E-\hat{H}_0\big) \hat{G}_0 |\mathbf{r}'\rangle &= \langle\mathbf{r}|\hat{I}|\mathbf{r}'\rangle \\
= \left(E + \frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 \right) \langle\mathbf{r} |\hat{G}_0 |\mathbf{r}'\rangle &= \delta^d(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}').
\end{aligned}$$

This gives

$$\left(\nabla^2 + k^2\right) \langle\mathbf{r} |\hat{G}_0 |\mathbf{r}'\rangle = \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \delta^d(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'),$${#eq-propagator}

where $k$, as usual, is the wavenumber corresponding to the particle
energy $E$.  The left side of this equation is the same as the
$d$-dimensional Helmholtz equation, with the $\nabla^2$ acting on the
$\mathbf{r}$ coordinates (not $\mathbf{r}'$).  On the right side, we
have a term proportional to a $d$-dimensional delta function at
$\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{r}'$.  The propagator thus describes a wave at
each position $\mathbf{r}$, emitted from a point source at
$\mathbf{r}'$.

@eq-propagator can be solved analytically for different values of the
spatial dimension $d$.  In the following, we will work through the
derivation for $d = 3$.  The derivations for $d = 1$ and $d = 2$ are
left as exercises.

### Derivation of the 3D propagator{#sec-3d-propagator}

To derive the propagator (or free-space Green's function) in 3D, let
us re-express it using the momentum eigenbasis:

$$\begin{aligned}
\langle\mathbf{r}|\hat{G}_0|\mathbf{r}'\rangle
&= \langle\mathbf{r}|\hat{G}_0 \Big(\int d^3k'\; |\mathbf{k}'\rangle\langle\mathbf{k}'| \Big) |\mathbf{r}'\rangle \nonumber \\
&= \int d^3k' \; \langle\mathbf{r}|\mathbf{k}'\rangle \;
\frac{1}{E-\frac{\hbar^2|\mathbf{k}'|^2}{2m}} \;
\langle\mathbf{k}'|\mathbf{r}'\rangle \nonumber \\
&= \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \frac{1}{(2\pi)^3} \int d^3k' \;
\frac{\exp\left[i\mathbf{k}' \cdot
(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}')\right]}{k^2-|\mathbf{k}'|^2}.\end{aligned}$$

Next, we express $\mathbf{k}'$ using spherical coordinates
$(k',\theta,\phi)$.  We are free to choose the $\theta=0$ axis so that
it points in the direction of $\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'$, as illustrated
below:

![](fig/spherical_coords.png){fig-align="center" width="500" fig-alt="Diagram of 3D spherical coordinates for the k' vector"}

The spherical integral can then be calculated as follows:

$$\begin{aligned}
\langle\mathbf{r}|\hat{G}_0|\mathbf{r}'\rangle &= \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \frac{1}{(2\pi)^3} \int d^3k' \; \frac{\exp\left[i\mathbf{k}'\cdot (\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}')\right]}{k^2-|\mathbf{k}'|^2} \nonumber \\
&= \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \frac{1}{(2\pi)^3} \int_0^\infty dk' \int_0^\pi d\theta \int_{0}^{2\pi} d\phi \;{k'}^{2}\sin\theta\; \frac{\displaystyle \exp\left(ik'|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|\cos\theta\right)}{k^2-{k'}^2} \nonumber \\
&= \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \frac{1}{(2\pi)^2} \int_0^\infty dk' \int_{-1}^1 d\mu \;{k'}^2\; \frac{\displaystyle \exp\left(ik'|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|\mu\right)}{k^2-{k'}^2} \qquad(\text{letting}\;\mu = \cos\theta) \nonumber \\
&= \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \frac{1}{(2\pi)^2} \int_0^\infty dk' \; \frac{ {k'}^2}{k^2-{k'}^2}\, \frac{\displaystyle \exp\left(ik'|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|\right) - \exp\left(-ik'|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|\right)}{ik'|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|} \nonumber\\
&= \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \frac{1}{(2\pi)^2} \frac{i}{|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|} \int_{-\infty}^\infty dk' \; \frac{\displaystyle k'\, \exp\left(ik'|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|\right)}{(k' - k)(k'+k)}.\end{aligned}$$

The resulting definite integral looks like something we can handle via
contour integration.  But there's a snag: the integration contour runs
over the real $k'$ line, but since $k \in \mathbb{R}^+$ the poles at
$\pm k$ lie on the contour.  The integral, as currently defined, is
singular.

To get a finite result, we must regularize the integral by adjusting
its definition.  One way is to perturb the integrand and shift its
poles infinitesimally in the complex plane, moving them off the
contour.  We have a choice of whether to move each pole
infinitesimally up or down.  It turns out that the appropriate choice
is to shift the pole at $-k$ down, and shift the pole at $+k$ up, as
illustrated by the red dots in the following figure:

![](fig/greencontour.png){fig-align="center" width="500" fig-alt="Contour plot for performing the Green's function integral, with the contour closed in the upper half-plane"}

This modifies the denominator in the integrand to

$$(k' - k)(k'+k) \;\rightarrow\; (k' - k - i\epsilon)(k'+k+i\epsilon) = {k'}^2 - (k+i\epsilon)^2,$${#eq-kregularization}

where $\epsilon$ is a positive infinitesimal.  The implications of
this adjustment will be discussed further below.  For now, let us
proceed to do the integral, which is no longer divergent:

$$\begin{aligned}\int_{-\infty}^\infty dk' \; \frac{\displaystyle k' \exp\left(ik'|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|\right)}{(k' - k)(k'+k)} &\rightarrow \lim_{\varepsilon \rightarrow 0^+} \int_{-\infty}^\infty dk' \; \frac{\displaystyle k' \exp\left(ik'|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|\right)}{(k' - k - i\varepsilon)(k'+k+i\varepsilon)}\;\;\; (\text{regularize}) \\ &= \lim_{\varepsilon \rightarrow 0^+} \int_C dk' \; \frac{\displaystyle k' \exp\left(ik'|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|\right)}{(k' - k - i\varepsilon)(k'+k+i\varepsilon)} \quad\;\;\; (\text{close contour above}) \\ &= 2\pi i \lim_{\varepsilon \rightarrow 0^+} \mathrm{Res}\left[\frac{\displaystyle k' \exp\left(ik'|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|\right)}{(k' - k - i\varepsilon)(k'+k+i\varepsilon)}, \;k'=k+i\varepsilon^+\right] \\ &= \pi i \exp\left(ik|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|\right).\end{aligned}$$

Finally, we obtain the result

$$\langle\mathbf{r}|\hat{G}_0|\mathbf{r}'\rangle = -\frac{2m}{\hbar^2}
\cdot \frac{\exp\left(ik|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|\right)}{4\pi|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|}.$$

This describes a **spherical wave** that is centered at the source
$\mathbf{r}'$, and isotropic (i.e., independent of the direction of
$\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}'$).  The wave amplitude decreases inversely
with $\Delta r = |\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|$, consistent with flux
conservation in 3D (see @sec-scattering-amplitudes).

Most importantly, we see from the $e^{ik|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|}$
factor that this spherical wave propagates \textit{outward} from
$\mathbf{r}'$.  This propagator is thus said to be \textbf{causal}, a
word based on the term "cause and effect": the wave travels from
$\mathbf{r}'$ (the cause) to $\mathbf{r}$ (the effect).  We can trace
this behavior back to the regularization in @eq-kregularization;
equivalently, this regularization can be expressed as an infinitesimal
shift in $E$,

$$\frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m} = E
\;\;\;\Rightarrow\;\;\;
\frac{\hbar^2 (k+i\epsilon)^2}{2m}
= \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \left(k^2 + 2ik\epsilon + \cdots\right)
= E + i\varepsilon.$$

Hence, the Green's function's original definition is replaced with a
**causal Green's function**,

$$\hat{G_0} = \lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow 0^+} \big(E - \hat{H}_0 + i \varepsilon\big)^{-1}.$${#eq-causal-green}

Similar causal propagators can also be derived for other dimensions.
The results for $d = 1, 2,$ and $3$ are summarized below:

$$\langle\mathbf{r}|\hat{G}_0|\mathbf{r}'\rangle = \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \times \begin{cases} \Bigg.\displaystyle\frac{1}{2ik} \exp\left(ik|x-x'|\right),& d=1\\ \Bigg. \displaystyle\frac{1}{4i} H^+_0(k|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'}|), & d=2 \\ \displaystyle \Bigg. - \frac{\exp\left(ik|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|\right)}{4\pi|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|}, & d = 3.  \end{cases}$$

For each $d$, the causal propagator describes a wave propagating
isotropically outward from $\mathbf{r}'$.  In 2D, the out-going
circular wave is described by a Hankel function (see Appendix A).

## Scattering amplitudes in 3D

We are now in a position to generate explicit solutions for the
scattering problem.  For ease of presentation, we will focus on the 3D
case; the 1D and 2D cases are handled in a similar way.

Using @eq-scattered-wave-form and @eq-psis_useful, we can write the
scattered wavefunction as

$$\psi_s(\mathbf{r})
= \langle\mathbf{r}|
\hat{G}_0 \hat{V}
\underbrace{\big(\hat{I} + \hat{G} \hat{V}\big) |\psi_i\rangle}_{= |\psi\rangle}
\\
\;\; \overset{r\rightarrow\infty}{\longrightarrow}\;\;
\Psi_i \, \frac{e^{ikr}}{r} \, f(\mathbf{k}_i\rightarrow k\hat{\mathbf{r}}).$$

We want to use this to find the scattering amplitude $f$, which
encodes the results of the scattering experiment in the large-$r$
limit (see @sec-scattering-amplitudes).

Let us work on the expression on the left first.  Using the position
representation,

$$\begin{aligned}
\psi_s(\mathbf{r}) = \int d^3r'\; \langle\mathbf{r}|\hat{G}_0|\mathbf{r}'\rangle\, V(\mathbf{r}')\, \langle \mathbf{r}'| \big(\hat{I} + \hat{G} \hat{V}\big) |\psi_i\rangle.\end{aligned}$${#eq-psis_positionrep}

The causal propagator in 3D, which we derived in @sec-3d-propagator, is

$$\langle\mathbf{r}|\hat{G}_0|\mathbf{r}'\rangle = - \frac{2m}{\hbar^2}
\frac{\exp\left(ik|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|\right)}{4\pi|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|}.$$

In the $r\rightarrow\infty$ limit, this can be simplified using the
Taylor expansion

$$|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}'| = r - \hat{\mathbf{r}} \cdot \mathbf{r}' + \cdots,$$

where $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ is the unit vector pointing parallel to
$\mathbf{r}$.  (This is the same large-$r$ expansion used to derive
the electric dipole moment in classical electromagnetism.)  Hence, to
lowest order,

$$\langle\mathbf{r}|\hat{G}_0|\mathbf{r}'\rangle \overset{r\rightarrow\infty}{\longrightarrow} - \frac{2m}{\hbar^2}\, \frac{e^{ikr}}{4\pi r}\; \exp\left(-ik \, \hat{\mathbf{r}} \cdot \mathbf{r}'\right).$$

Applying this to @eq-psis_positionrep gives

$$\begin{aligned}\psi_s(\mathbf{r})
&\overset{r\rightarrow\infty}{\longrightarrow} \, - \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \, \frac{e^{ikr}}{4\pi r}\; \int d^3r' \exp\left(-ik \, \hat{\mathbf{r}} \cdot \mathbf{r}'\right)\, V(\mathbf{r}')\,
\langle \mathbf{r}'| \big(\hat{I} + \hat{G} \hat{V}\big) |\psi_i\rangle \\
&\;\;=\;\; - \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \, \frac{e^{ikr}}{r} \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}} \; \big\langle \mathbf{k}_f \big|\hat{V} + \hat{V} \hat{G} \hat{V}
\big|\psi_i\big\rangle. \end{aligned}$$ {#eq-psis_intermediate}

On the second line, we simplified the expression by introducing the
momentum eigenstate with $\mathbf{k}_f \equiv k \hat{\mathbf{r}}$.
This corresponds to the "final" momentum of the scattered particle,
measured when the particle is picked up by a detector placed in the
$\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ direction relative to the origin.  Note that
$|\mathbf{k}_f| = |\mathbf{k}_i| = k$, consistent with elastic
scattering.

Likewise, we can relate the incident state, @eq-psiin, to a
delta-normalized momentum eigenstate (see @sec-momentum-eigenstates):

$$|\psi_i\rangle = \Psi_i (2\pi)^{3/2} |\mathbf{k}_i\rangle.$$

Then @eq-psis_intermediate becomes

$$\begin{aligned}\psi_s(\mathbf{r}) \; &\overset{r\rightarrow\infty}{\longrightarrow} - \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \, \Psi_i\, \frac{e^{ikr}}{r} \; 2\pi^2 \; \big\langle \mathbf{k}_f \big|\hat{V} + \hat{V}\hat{G}\hat{V}\big|\mathbf{k}_i\big\rangle.\end{aligned}$$

Comparing this to @eq-scattered-wave-form, we can read off the
scattering amplitude:

$$\begin{aligned}
f(\mathbf{k}_i \rightarrow \mathbf{k}_f) &= - \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \,\cdot \, 2\pi^2 \; \big\langle \mathbf{k}_f\big| \hat{V} + \hat{V}\hat{G} \hat{V} \big|\mathbf{k}_i\big\rangle \\
&= - \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \,\cdot \, 2\pi^2 \; \big\langle \mathbf{k}_f\big| \hat{V} + \hat{V}\hat{G}_0 \hat{V} + \hat{V} \hat{G}_0 \hat{V} \hat{G}_0\hat{V} + \cdots \big|\mathbf{k}_i\big\rangle.  \end{aligned}$${#eq-fresult}

As usual, this is subject to the elasticity constraint $|\mathbf{k}_i|
= |\mathbf{k}_f|$.  We obtained the infinite series on the second line
by applying Dyson's equations, @eq-dyson, repeatedly (i.e., this is
the Born series; see @sec-born-series).

@eq-fresult is the culmination of numerous definitions and derivations
from the preceding sections.  On the left side is the scattering
amplitude, the fundamental quantity of interest in a scattering
experiment.  The right side contains the various inputs to the
scattering problem: the initial and final momenta, the scattering
potential, and the Green's function.  Although this result was derived
for the 3D case, very similar formulas hold for other dimensions, with
the $2\pi^2$ factor replaced with other numerical factors.

### Example: uniform spherical well in 3D

Let us test the Born series with a simple scatterer.  Consider a
scattering potential that consists of a uniform spherical well of
depth $U > 0$ and radius $R$:

$$V(\mathbf{r}) = \begin{cases}-U, & |\mathbf{r}| \le R \\ \;\;\;\,0,
& |\mathbf{r}| > 0. \end{cases}$$

As it turns out, this particular scattering problem can be solved
exactly by exploiting the spherical symmetry of $V(\mathbf{r})$.  The
solution method, called **partial wave analysis**, is explained in
Appendix A.  Its result is

$$\begin{aligned}f(\mathbf{k}_i \rightarrow \mathbf{k}_f) &= \frac{1}{2ik}\, \sum_{\ell =0}^\infty \big(e^{2i\delta_\ell} - 1\big) \big(2\ell+1\big)\, P_{\ell}(\hat{\mathbf{k}}_i\cdot \hat{\mathbf{k}}_f), \\ \mathrm{where}\;\; \delta_\ell &= \frac{\pi}{2} + \mathrm{arg}\!\left[k {h_\ell^+}'(kR) \, j_\ell(qR) - qh_\ell^+(kR)\, j_\ell'(qR)\right], \\ q &= \sqrt{2m(E+U)/\hbar^2} \\ k &\equiv |\mathbf{k}_i| = |\mathbf{k}_f|.\end{aligned}$${#eq-fresult_well}

The solution is expressed in terms of the special functions $j_\ell$
(spherical Bessel function of the first kind), $h_\ell^+$ (spherical
Hankel function of the first kind), and $P_\ell$ (Legendre
polynomial).

We will pit this against the Born series, which can be regarded as a
more general method since it does not assume spherical symmetry.
According to @eq-fresult,

$$f(\mathbf{k}_i\rightarrow \mathbf{k}_f) = - \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \,\cdot \, 2\pi^2 \, \left[\big\langle \mathbf{k}_f\big| \hat{V}|\mathbf{k}_i\big\rangle + \big\langle \mathbf{k}_f \big| \hat{V}\hat{G}_0 \hat{V} \big|\mathbf{k}_i\big\rangle + \cdots \right].$$

Evaluating the full infinite Born series is generally an intractable
problem, but we can truncate it to get an approximation for $f$.  If
we keep only the first term, the result is called the **first Born
approximation**; keeping only the first two terms yields the **second
Born approximation**; and so forth.  To evaluate the various bra-kets,
we can use the position representation to express them as explicit
integrals.  For example,

$$\begin{aligned}
\big\langle \mathbf{k}_f\big| \hat{V}|\mathbf{k}_i\big\rangle
&= \int d^3r_1\; \frac{\exp(-i\mathbf{k}_f \cdot \mathbf{r}_1)}{(2\pi)^{3/2}} \, V(\mathbf{r}_1) \, \frac{\exp(i\mathbf{k}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_1)}{(2\pi)^{3/2}}
 \\
&= - \frac{U}{8\pi^3} \int_{|\mathbf{r}_1| \le R} d^3r_1 \; \exp\left[i(\mathbf{k}_i-\mathbf{k}_f)\, \cdot\, \mathbf{r}_1\right] \\
\big\langle \mathbf{k}_f \big| \hat{V}\hat{G}_0 \hat{V} \big|\mathbf{k}_i\big\rangle &=
\int d^3r_1 \!\! \int d^3r_2 \; \frac{\exp(-i\mathbf{k}_f \cdot \mathbf{r}_2)}{(2\pi)^{3/2}} \, V(\mathbf{r}_2) \, \langle\mathbf{r}_2|\hat{G}_0|\mathbf{r}_1 \rangle \, V(\mathbf{r}_1)\, \frac{\exp(i\mathbf{k}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_1)}{(2\pi)^{3/2}} \\
&= - \frac{U^2}{32\pi^4} \, \frac{2m}{\hbar^2}\, \int_{|\mathbf{r}_1|<R} d^3 r_1 \int_{|\mathbf{r}_2|<R} d^3 r_2 \; \frac{\exp\left[i(k|\mathbf{r}_1-\mathbf{r}_2| - \mathbf{k}_f \cdot \mathbf{r}_2 +\mathbf{k}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_1)\right]}{|\mathbf{r}_1-\mathbf{r}_2|}.
\end{aligned}$$

To evaluate the integrals, an expedient approach is Monte Carlo
integration.  For instance, to approximate the integral

$$I = \int_{|\mathrm{r}|<R} d^3r \, F(\mathbf{r}),$$

we randomly sample $N$ points within a cube of volume $V$ large enough
to enclose the scatterer; for each sampled point, $\mathbf{r}_n$, we
calculate $F_n = F(\mathbf{r}_n)$ (which is set to zero if
$\mathbf{r}_n$ falls outside the scatterer); finally, we take

$$I \,\approx\, V \, \langle F_n\rangle \,=\, \frac{V}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N F_n,$$

which converges to the true integral as $N\rightarrow\infty$.  The
same procedure can also be used to calculate the integrals for
higher-order terms in the Born series.

The figure below compares the Born approximation to the exact
solution, @eq-fresult_well}, for two well depths ($U = 0.1$ and $U =
1$), with the same radius $R = 1$.  We plot $|f|^2$ versus $E$ at a
$90^\circ$ scattering angle (i.e., $\mathbf{k}_f$ perpendicular to
$\mathbf{k}_i$), using computational units $\hbar = m = 1$.  Each
Monte Carlo integral is computed using $3\times10^4$ samples.

![](fig/spherical_well_scattering.png){fig-align="center" width="500" fig-alt="Numerical results showing the differential scattering cross section, plotted against energy, for two spherical potential wells of different depths"}

First, notice that $|f|^2$ diminishes to zero for large $E$.  This
makes sense: the scattering potential has some energy scale $\sim U$,
so a particle with energy $E \gg U$ should simply zoom through, with
little chance of being deflected.

Looking more closely, we see that for the shallower well ($U = 0.1$),
the first Born approximation already agrees quite well with the exact
results.  However, the second Born approximation is significantly more
accurate, particularly for small $E$.

For the deeper well ($U = 1$), neither the first nor second Born
approximations do a good job.  Roughly speaking, for the deep
potential well, we cannot neglect multiple-scattering events
represented by higher terms in the Born series, whereby the particle
bounces around many times before leaving the scatterer.  In fact, for
very strong scattering potentials, even taking the Born approximation
to high orders may not work, as the Born series may become
non-convergent.  In such cases, different methods must be brought to
bear.  We will see an example in the next chapter.

## Exercises

1. Using the results for the 1D delta-function scattering problem from
@sec-1d-scattering, calculate the probability current

$$J(x) = \frac{\hbar}{2mi}\left(\psi^*\frac{d\psi}{dx} - \psi\frac{d\psi^*}{dx}\right),$$

where $\psi(x)$ is the \textit{total} (incident + scattered)
wavefunction.  Explain the relationship between the values of $J$ on
the left and right side of the scatterer.

2. Derive the causal 1D propagator:

$$\langle x|\hat{G}_0|x'\rangle = \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \cdot \frac{1}{2ik_i} \exp\left(ik_i|x-x'|\right).$$

3. Derive the causal 2D propagator:

$$\langle\mathbf{r}|\hat{G}_0|\mathbf{r}'\rangle = \frac{2m}{\hbar^2}\;
\frac{1}{4i} H^+_0(k|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'}|).$$

You should be able to adapt many of the steps in the 3D propagator
derivation from @sec-3d-propagator.  When evaluating the polar
integral, you may want to refer to the discussion of Bessel and Hankel
functions in Appendix A.  You may also need the following mathematical
identity between the Hankel functions:

$$H_m^+(z) = - (-1)^m \, H_m^-(-z).$$

4. In place of the causal Green's function, @eq-causal-green, consider
an **anticausal propagator** defined by using an infinitesimal
imaginary energy shift of the opposite sign:
$$\hat{G_0} = \lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow 0^+} \big(E - \hat{H}_0 - i \varepsilon\big)^{-1}.$$
    A. Whereas the causal propagators represent outgoing waves, explain
why anticausal propagators represent incoming waves.

    B. By adapting the derivation in @sec-3d-propagator, derive the
anticausal propagator in 3D space.  (Hint: you will need to change
the contour integral.)

5. @eq-fresult gives an expression for the scattering amplitude, but
it applies specifically to 3D space.  Derive the corresponding
expressions for 1D and 2D.
