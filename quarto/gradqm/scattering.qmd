# Scattering Theory

## The double-slit experiment

A famous property of quantum mechanical particles is **wave-particle
duality**, whose essential features can be succinctly described via
the following thought experiment:

Suppose a source emits electrons of energy $E$ toward a screen with a
pair of slits, as shown below.  A movable detector, placed on the far
side, measures the arrival rates at different positions.

![](fig/doubleslit.png){fig-align="center" width="500" fig-alt="Schematic of a double-slit experiment"}

Were we to perform such an experiment, we would observe the following:

1. The electrons arrive in discrete units, similar to classical
   particles;

2. Yet the *statistical* distribution of the electron arrivals forms
   an interference pattern, like a wave undergoing diffraction.  In
   the non-relativistic limit, the inferred wavelength $\lambda$ is
   related to the electron energy $E$ by
$$\lambda = \frac{2\pi}{k}, \;\;\; E = \frac{\hbar^2k^2}{2m},$$
where $m$ is the electron mass.  As a corollary, if $E$ is
known, we can use this interference pattern to deduce the spacing of
the slits.

In this chapter, we will study a generalization of the double-slit
experiment called a **scattering experiment**.  The idea is to shoot
quantum particles at a target, called a **scatterer**, and measure the
distribution of scattered particles.  Just as the double-slit
interference pattern can be used to deduce the slit spacing, we can
use a scattering experiment to learn things about the scatterer.  In
fact, scattering experiments constitute a large proportion of the
methods that are used to probe the quantum world, from electron- and
photon-based microscopy to accelerator experiments in high-energy
physics.

## The scattering problem

The figure below depicts the kind of scattering experiment we
intend to study:

![](fig/scattering.png){fig-align="center" width="500" fig-alt="Schematic of a scattering experiment"}

In an unbounded $d$-dimensional space (typically, we will have $d=3$,
but let us keep our options open), there is an object called a
scatterer.  Without loss of generality, we assume the scatterer is
placed near the coordinate origin, $\mathbf{r} = 0$.  We now shoot
quantum particles of energy $E$ at the scatterer.

Let us assume that these particles do not interact with each other, in
which case we can just analyze the behavior of an individual,
representative, particle.  Moreover, let us assume that (i) this
particle is non-relativistic, and (ii) the particle "sees" the
scatterer as some potential energy function $V(\mathbf{r})$, called
the **scattering potential**.  Thus, the particle is governed by the
Hamiltonian

$$\hat{H} = \hat{H}_0 + V(\hat{\mathbf{r}}), \;\;\; \hat{H}_0 = \frac{\hat{\mathbf{p}}^2}{2m},$$

where $m$ is the particle mass, and $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ and
$\hat{\mathbf{p}}$ are the position and momentum operators.  Outside
the scatterer, we assume that space is empty, so the potential
function vanishes at large distances:

$$V(\mathbf{r}) \; \overset{|\mathbf{r}| \rightarrow \infty}{\longrightarrow}\; 0.$$

Next up, we need to formulate the mathematical problem whose solution
will describe how the incident particle is affected by the scatterer.
Let us state the formulation first, before elaborating on its meaning
later.  It consists of the following pieces:

1. Define a particle state $|\psi\rangle$, called the **total state**, that obeys the time-independent Schrödinger equation
$$\hat{H} |\psi\rangle = E |\psi\rangle,$$
where $E$ is the incoming particle energy.

2. The total state $|\psi\rangle$ can be decomposed into two pieces,
$$|\psi\rangle \,=\, |\psi_i\rangle \,+\, |\psi_s\rangle,$$
where $|\psi_i\rangle$ is called the **incident state** and
$|\psi_s\rangle$ is called the **scattered state**.

3. The incident state is described by a plane wave, which is a
simultaneous eigenstate of $\hat{H}_0$ and $\hat{\mathbf{p}}$:
$$\begin{cases}
\hat{H}_0 |\psi_i\rangle &= \, E |\psi_i\rangle, \\
\;\;\hat{\mathbf{p}} |\psi_i\rangle &= \, \mathbf{p}_i |\psi_i\rangle,
\end{cases}
\quad \mathrm{where} \;\;\; E = \frac{|\mathbf{p}_i|^2}{2m}.
\label{scatter3}
$$

4. The scattered state is an "outgoing" state.  The meaning of this is
a little subtle, so let us fill in this part later.

We can interpret the above statements as follows.  Statement 1 says
the scattering is elastic: the scatterer is described by a potential
$V(\mathbf{r})$, so its interaction with the particle is conservative
and $E$ is fixed.  Statement 2 says that the wavefunction
$\psi(\mathbf{r}) = \langle \mathbf{r} |\psi\rangle$ is a
superposition of an incoming wave and a scattered wave.  Statement 3
defines the incoming wave as a plane wave with wavelength determined
by $E$.  Statement 4 says the scattered wave moves outward to
infinity, away from the scatterer.

Note that Statements 1--4 do *not* define an eigenproblem!  Usually,
we deal with the time-independent Schröodinger equation by finding
eigenvalues and eigenstates.  But here we are given $|\psi_i\rangle$,
$E$, and $V(\mathbf{r})$, and want $|\psi_s\rangle$.  In particular,
$E$ is an input to the calculation (a continuously variable
parameter), not an output (an eigenvalue).

## Scattering from a 1D delta function potential

We are now ready to solve a simple scattering problem.  Consider a 1D
space with spatial coordinate $x$, and a scattering potential
consisting of a "spike" at $x = 0$:

$$V(x) = \frac{\hbar^2\gamma}{2m} \,\delta(x).$$

The form of the prefactor $\hbar^2\gamma/2m$ is chosen for later
convenience; the parameter $\gamma$, which has units of $[1/x]$,
controls the strength of the scattering potential.

<!-- \begin{figure}[h] -->
<!--   \centering\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{scattering1d} -->
<!-- \end{figure} -->

The particle wavefunction $\psi(x)$ satisfies the 1D Schrödinger
wave equation

$$\left[-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{d^2}{dx^2} + V(x) \right] \psi(x) = E \psi(x).$$

As this is a second-order differential equation, we normally require
$\psi(x)$ to be continuous and to have well-defined first and second
derivatives.  However, the delta function potential \eqref{Vdeltaf}
relaxes these requirements in a peculiar way: at $x=0$, $\psi(x)$ must
still be continuous, but its first derivative may now be discontinuous
(and hence, its second derivative is singular).  To see this,
integrate Eq.~\eqref{1dschrod} over an infinitesimal range around $x =
0$:

$$\begin{aligned}\lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow 0^+} \int_{-\varepsilon}^{+\varepsilon} dx\; \left[-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{d^2}{dx^2} + \frac{\hbar^2\gamma}{2m} \delta(x)\right] \psi(x) &= \lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow 0^+} \int_{-\varepsilon}^{+\varepsilon} dx\; E \psi(x) \\ = \lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow 0^+} \left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \left[\frac{d\psi}{dx}\right]_{-\varepsilon}^{+\varepsilon} \right) + \frac{\hbar^2\gamma}{2m} \psi(0) &= 0.
\end{aligned}$$

Therefore,

$$\lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow 0^+} \left(\; \left.\frac{d\psi}{dx}\right|_{x = +\varepsilon} - \;\; \left.\frac{d\psi}{dx}\right|_{x = -\varepsilon}\; \right) =  \gamma \,\psi(0).$$

In accordance our previously-discussed formulation of the scattering
problem, the total wavefunction is split into

$$\psi(x) = \psi_i(x) + \psi_s(x).$$

Moreover, the incident state should be a momentum eigenstate.  But we
will *not* let it be delta-normalized, as momentum eigenstates
normally are.  Instead, we write

$$\psi_i(x) = \Psi_i \, e^{ik x}, \;\;\;k = \sqrt{\frac{2mE}{\hbar^2}} > 0.$$

The complex coefficient $\Psi_i$ is called the **incident amplitude**.
Introducing $\Psi_i$ in this way emphasizes that the magnitude and
phase of the incident wavefunction are, in principle, adjustable
parameters in the scattering experiment.  In terms of the usual
delta-normalized momentum eigenstates,

$$|\psi_i\rangle = \sqrt{2\pi}\, \Psi_i |k\rangle.$$

With this, the 1D Schrödinger equation becomes

$$\left[-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{d^2}{dx^2} + \frac{\hbar^2\gamma}{2m}\delta(x)\right] \Big(\Psi_i \, e^{ikx} + \psi_s(x) \Big)
  = E \Big(\Psi_i \, e^{ikx} + \psi_s(x) \Big).$$


Taking $E = \hbar^2k^2/2m$, and doing a bit of algebra, simplifies this to

$$\left[ \frac{d^2}{dx^2} + k^2\right] \psi_s(x)
  = \gamma \delta(x) \Big(\Psi_i \, e^{ikx} + \psi_s(x) \Big).$$

We can construct the solution by separately considering the regions $x
< 0$ and $x > 0$.  Within each half-space, $\delta(x)$ vanishes so
Eq.~\eqref{deltaschrod} reduces to the Helmholtz equation

$$\left[\frac{d^2}{dx^2} + k^2\right] \psi_s(x) = 0.$$

This has the general solution

$$\psi_s(x) = \Psi_i \left(f_R \, e^{ik x} + f_L \, e^{-ik x}\right),$$

which is a superposition of right-moving ($e^{ikx}$) and left-moving
($e^{-ikx}$) waves.  The complex parameters $f_1$ and $f_2$ can have
different values in the $x < 0$ and $x > 0$ regions.

We want the scattered wave to be an outgoing wave.  Thus, for $x < 0$,
$\psi_s$ is purely left-moving, so $f_R = 0$; and for $x > 0$,
$\psi_s$ is purely right-moving, so $f_L = 0$.  Therefore,

$$\psi_s(x) = \Psi_i \times \begin{cases}f_- \,e^{-ikx}, & x < 0 \\ f_+ \,e^{ikx}, & x > 0.\end{cases}$$

The complex numbers $f_-$ and $f_+$ are called **scattering
amplitudes**.  They parameterize the magnitude and phase of the
scattered wavefunction moving outward from the scatterer.

Recall from the discussion at the beginning of this section that
$\psi(x)$ must be continuous at $x = 0$.  This implies that
$\psi_s(x)$ is also continuous, and therefore that

$$f_- = f_+ \;\;\;\Rightarrow \;\;\; \psi_s(x) = \Psi_i \,f_\pm\, e^{ik|x|}.$$

Plugging Eqs.~\eqref{psiin1d} and \eqref{psis1d} into
Eq.~\eqref{delta_discontinuity} yields

$$f_\pm = -\frac{\gamma}{\gamma - 2ik}.$$

For now, let us focus on the magnitude of the scattering amplitude (in
the next chapter, we will see that the phase also contains useful
information).  The quantity $|f_\pm|^2$ describes the overall strength
of the scattering process:

$$|f_\pm|^2 = \left[1 + \frac{8mE}{(\hbar\gamma)^2}\right]^{-1}.$$

Its dependence on $E$ is plotted below:

<!-- \begin{figure}[h] -->
<!--   \centering\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{scattering1df} -->
<!-- \end{figure} -->

The behavior matches our intuition.  For a given particle energy $E$,
the scattering grows stronger as the potential strength parameter
$|\gamma|$ increases.  On the other hand, for fixed $\gamma$, a
higher-energy particle undergoes less scattering.  Note also that
attractive potentials ($\gamma < 0$) and repulsive potentials ($\gamma
> 0$) are equally effective at scattering.

## Scattering amplitude and scattering cross section

In the 1D scattering problem of the previous section, the particle can
only scatter in two directions: forward or backward.  In 2D and higher
spatial dimensions, there is an important complication: the particle
can also go sideways, and in fact there is a continuous set of
directions for it to scatter into.  To deal with this, physicists have
developed a systematic formalism for expressing the outcomes of
scattering experiments using direction-dependent **scattering
amplitudes**, which we will now describe.

To begin, let us define the incident wavefunction as a plane wave in
$d$ dimensions, by analogy with the 1D case [Eq.~\eqref{psiin1d}]:

$$\psi_i(\mathbf{r}) = \Psi_i \, e^{i\mathbf{k}_i\cdot\mathbf{r}},
\;\;\; |\mathbf{k}_i| = k = \sqrt{\frac{2mE}{\hbar^2}},$$

where $\mathbf{k}_i$ is the incident wave-vector and $\Psi_i \in
\mathbb{C}$ is the incident amplitude.

The incident wavefunction generates a scattered wavefunction
$\psi_s(\mathbf{r})$.  We can express the $\mathbf{r}$-dependence of
this wavefunction using a coordinate system of the form $(r,\Omega)$,
where $r$ is the distance from the origin and $\Omega$ denotes the
other directional coordinates.  Specifically,

* For $d = 2$, we use polar coordinates $(r,\phi)$, i.e.~$\Omega
\equiv \phi$.

* For $d = 3$, we use spherical coordinates $(r, \theta, \phi)$,
  i.e.~$\Omega \equiv (\theta,\phi)$.

We can also wrangle the $d = 1$ case into this framework by letting
  $\Omega \in \{+, -\}$, where $+$ denotes the forward ($+x$)
  direction and $-$ denotes the backward ($-x$) direction.

In a typical scattering experiment, the scattered wavefunction is
detected at $r \rightarrow \infty$; i.e., at distances much longer
than the size of the scatterer, the free-space wavelength, and any
other relevant length scales.  In this regime, we assert that the
scattered wavefunction must reduce to the form

$$\psi_s(\mathbf{r})\;  \overset{r\rightarrow\infty}{\longrightarrow}\; \Psi_i \, r^{\frac{1-d}{2}} \, e^{ikr} \, f(\Omega).$$

To understand the reasoning behind this, let us go through the
individual multiplicative factors on the right side of the equation.

The first factor $\Psi_i$ accounts for the fact that the Schrödinger
wave equation is linear.  If we vary the incident amplitude, the
scattered wavefunction must vary proportionally.

The next two factors, $r^{\frac{1-d}{2}} \, e^{ikr}$, give the
$r$-dependence of a wave expanding radially from the origin in $d$
dimensions.  The $e^{ikr}$ factor captures its outgoing nature (the
wavefunction's phase increases along the direction of propagation,
i.e., the direction of increasing $r$).  The other factor provides the
$r$-scaling needed for probability conservation.  Note that the
probability current density associated with the scattered wavefunction
is

$$ \mathbf{J}_s = \frac{\hbar}{m} \mathrm{Im}\big[\psi_s^*\nabla\psi_s\big].$$

Thus, its radial component is

$$\begin{aligned}J_{s}^r\; &= \frac{\hbar}{m}\, \mathrm{Im}\left[\psi_s^* \frac{\partial}{\partial r}\psi_s\right] \\
&\overset{r\rightarrow\infty}{\longrightarrow}\;\, \big(\cdots\big)
\mathrm{Im}\left[\left(r^{\frac{1-d}{2}} \, e^{ikr}\right)^* \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left(r^{\frac{1-d}{2}} \, e^{ikr}\right)\right] \\
&= \big(\cdots\big)\,
\mathrm{Im}\left[\left(r^{\frac{1-d}{2}} \, e^{ikr}\right)^* \left(ik r^{\frac{1-d}{2}} \, e^{ikr} + \frac{1-d}{2} \, r^{\frac{-1-d}{2}} \, e^{ikr}\right)\right] \\
&= \big(\cdots\big) \, r^{-(d-1)} + O(r^{-d}),\end{aligned}$$

where $(\cdots)$ denotes $r$-independent terms.  In $d$ dimensions,
the area of the surface at distance $r$ from the origin scales as
$r^{d-1}$.  Hence, $J_{s}^r$ scales inversely with area, and the total
flux obtained by integrating $J_{s}^r$ over the area is independent of
$r$.

The final factor, $f(\Omega)$, is called the \textbf{scattering
amplitude}.  This complex function is typically the main avenue by
which a scattering experiment reveals information about the scatterer.
As noted in the previous paragraphs, in the large-$r$ limit, the other
factors are determined by linearity, outgoing-ness, and flux
conservation.  Hence, only $f$ is sensitive to the details of the
scattering potential.

Note that the scattering amplitude is a function of $\Omega$, i.e.,
the direction of $\mathbf{r}$.  Sometimes, it is written using the
alternative notation

$$f(\mathbf{k}_i \rightarrow \mathbf{k}_f), \qquad \mathbf{k}_f = k\, \frac{\mathbf{r}}{|\mathbf{r}|}.$$

This emphasizes that the particle is initially incident with
wave-vector $\mathbf{k}_i$, then gets scattered elastically into a
wave-vector $\mathbf{k}_f$ pointing in the direction of $\mathbf{r}$.

From the scattering amplitude, we can define two other important
quantities:

$$\begin{aligned}\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} &= \big|f(\Omega)\big|^2 \qquad\quad\quad \text{(the \textbf{differential scattering cross section})} \\ \sigma &= \int d\Omega\; \big|f(\Omega)\big|^2 \quad\; \text{(the \textbf{total scattering cross section}).}\end{aligned}$$

Here, $\int d\Omega$ denotes the integral(s) over all the angle
coordinates.  For 1D, this is replaced by a discrete sum over the
forward and backward directions (see above).

The term "cross section" comes from an analogy with the scattering of
classical particles.  Imagine a stream of classical particles incident
on a "hard-body" scatterer:

<!-- \begin{figure}[h] -->
<!--   \centering\includegraphics[width=0.44\textwidth]{crosssection} -->
<!-- \end{figure} -->

Let the incident classical particles have the same flux as the
incident wavefunction \eqref{psiin},

$$J_{i} = \frac{\hbar k}{m} \;|\Psi_i|^2.$$

Note that this has units of $[x^{1-d}t^{-1}]$ (i.e., number per unit
time per unit area in $d$ dimensions).  We assume the scatterer only
interacts with the particles striking it directly, and the rate at
which these strikes occur is

$$I_s = J_i \, \sigma,$$

where $\sigma$ is the exposed cross-sectional area of the scatterer,
as shown in the figure.  This is the *total* rate at which scattering
occurs, regardless of where the particles scatter to.

Let us compare this to the quantum mechanical scattering rate.  Using
Eq.~\eqref{psiscat}, we can repeat the calculation in \eqref{Jsrcalc}
for the radial component of the probability current density:

$$J_s^r \; \overset{r\rightarrow\infty}{\longrightarrow}\;
  \frac{\hbar \,k}{m}\; |\Psi_i|^2 \; |f(\Omega)|^2 \,r^{1-d}
  + O(r^{-d}).$$

Hence, the total flux of outgoing probability is

$$I_s = \int d\Omega\; r^{d-1} \, J_{s,r}
  = \left(\frac{\hbar k}{m} \;|\Psi_i|^2\right) \; \int d\Omega\; \big|f(\Omega)\big|^2.$$

On the right side, the quantity in parentheses is the incident flux,
Eq.~\eqref{incidentflux}.  Comparing Eq.~\eqref{scatterI} to
Eq.~\eqref{scattersigma}, we see that

$$\sigma \equiv \int d\Omega \; \big|f(\Omega)\big|^2$$

is the quantity analogous to the exposed cross-sectional area of the
classical hard-body.  We therefore call this the \textbf{total
scattering cross section}.

Moreover, the integrand $|f|^2$ represents the rate, per unit of solid
angle, at which particles are scattered in a given direction.  We call
this the **differential scattering cross section**.  The total
and differential scattering cross sections are the principal
observable quantities typically obtained in scattering experiments.

## The Green's function

The scattering amplitude $f(\Omega)$ can be calculated using a variety
of analytical and numerical methods.  We will discuss one particularly
important approach, based on a quantum variant of the Green's function
technique for solving inhomogenous differential equations.

Let us return to the previously-discussed formulation of the
scattering problem:
$$\begin{aligned} \hat{H} &= \hat{H}_0+\hat{V} \\ \hat{H} |\psi\rangle &= E |\psi\rangle \\ |\psi\rangle &= |\psi_i\rangle \,+\, |\psi_s\rangle \\ \hat{H}_0 |\psi_i\rangle &= E |\psi_i\rangle.\end{aligned}$$

These equations can be combined as follows:

$$\begin{aligned}
  \left(\hat{H}_0 + \hat{V}\right) |\psi_i\rangle + \hat{H} |\psi_s\rangle &= E \left( |\psi_i\rangle + |\psi_s\rangle \right) \\
  \Rightarrow \quad \hat{V} |\psi_i\rangle + \hat{H} |\psi_s\rangle &= E |\psi_s\rangle  \\
  \Rightarrow \quad\; \left(E - \hat{H}\right) |\psi_s\rangle & = \hat{V} |\psi_i\rangle \end{aligned}$$

To proceed, we define an operator called the **Green's function**:

$$\hat{G}(E) = \big(E-\hat{H}\big)^{-1}.$$

Note that $\hat{G}(E)$ depends parametrically on $E$.  We can now
convert Eq.~\eqref{EmHeq} into

$$|\psi_s\rangle = \hat{G} \hat{V} |\psi_i\rangle.$$

It will also be useful to define the Green's function for a free
particle,

$$\hat{G}_0(E)=\big(E-\hat{H}_0\big)^{-1}.$$

As we shall see, $\hat{G}_0$ often can be calculated exactly, whereas
$\hat{G}$ typically has no closed-form analytic expression.  Moreover,
we can relate $G$ and $G_0$ as follows:

$$\begin{aligned}
\hat{G}(E-\hat{H}_0 - \hat{V})\;\; &= I \;\;\;\mathrm{and}\;\; (E-\hat{H}_0 - \hat{V})\hat{G} = I \\ \Leftrightarrow \quad\qquad \hat{G} \hat{G}_0^{-1} - \hat{G}\hat{V} &= I \;\;\; \mathrm{and}\;\;\;\;\, \hat{G}_0^{-1} \hat{G} - \hat{V}\hat{G} \;\;\;= I.
\end{aligned}$$

Upon respectively right-multiplying and left-multiplying these equations
by $\hat{G}_0$, we arrive at the following pair of equations, called
**Dyson's equations**:

$$\begin{aligned}
\hat{G} \;&= \; \hat{G}_0 + \hat{G}\hat{V}\hat{G}_0 \\
\hat{G} \;&=\; \hat{G}_0 + \hat{G}_0\hat{V}\hat{G} \label{dyson2}
\end{aligned}$$

These equations are *implicit*, as the unknown $\hat{G}$ appears on
both the left and right sides.

Applying the second Dyson equation, Eq.~\eqref{dyson2}, to the
scattering problem \eqref{scatterform} gives

$$\begin{aligned}
|\psi_s\rangle
&= \left(\hat{G}_0 + \hat{G}_0\hat{V}\hat{G}\right) \hat{V}
\, |\psi_i\rangle \\
&= \hat{G}_0 \hat{V} \left(\hat{I} + \hat{G} \hat{V}\right) |\psi_i\rangle.
\label{psis_useful}
\end{aligned}$$

Using Eq.~\eqref{scatterform} again, we get

$$|\psi_s\rangle = \hat{G}_0\hat{V} |\psi\rangle.$$

This remains an implicit equation, but the unknown is $|\psi\rangle$
rather than $\hat{G}$.  Note that the results up to this point have
been approximation-free.

One approach to solving Eq.~\eqref{psis_implicity} is to repeatedly
plug its right side back into itself:

$$\begin{aligned}
|\psi_s\rangle &= \hat{G}_0 \hat{V} \left(|\psi_i\rangle + \hat{G}_0 \hat{V}|\psi\rangle\right) \\
&= \quad \vdots \\
&= \left[\hat{G}_0 \hat{V} + (\hat{G}_0 \hat{V})^2 + (\hat{G}_0 \hat{V})^3 + \cdots\right]|\psi_i\rangle.
\end{aligned}$$

Or, equivalently,

$$|\psi\rangle
= \left[\hat{I} + \hat{G}_0 \hat{V} + (\hat{G}_0 \hat{V})^2 + (\hat{G}_0 \hat{V})^3 + \cdots\right]|\psi_i\rangle.$$

This infinite series is called the **Born series**.

To interpret this result, let us go to the position basis:

$$\begin{aligned}\psi(\mathbf{r}) = \psi_i(\mathbf{r}) &+ \int d^dr' \langle \mathbf{r} | \hat{G}_0 |\mathbf{r}'\rangle\, V(\mathbf{r}') \psi_i(\mathbf{r}') \\ &+ \int d^dr' d^dr'' \langle \mathbf{r} | \hat{G}_0 |\mathbf{r}'\rangle\, V(\mathbf{r}') \, \langle \mathbf{r}' | \hat{G}_0 |\mathbf{r}''\rangle \, V(\mathbf{r}'') \psi_i(\mathbf{r}'') \;\; + \;\;\cdots\end{aligned}$$

This can be regarded as a description of **multiple scattering**.
The wavefunction is a superposition of terms involving zero, one, two,
or more scattering events, as shown below:

<!-- \begin{figure}[h!] -->
<!-- \centering\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{bornseries} -->
<!-- \end{figure} -->

Each successive term in the Born series involves more scattering
events, i.e., higher multiples of $\hat{V}$.  For example, the
second-order term is

$$\int d^dr' d^dr'' \langle \mathbf{r} | \hat{G}_0 |\mathbf{r}'\rangle\, V(\mathbf{r}') \, \langle \mathbf{r}' | \hat{G}_0 |\mathbf{r}''\rangle \, V(\mathbf{r}'') \psi_i(\mathbf{r}''),$$

which describes the particle undergoing (i) scattering of the incident
particle at point $\mathbf{r}''$, (ii) propagation from $\mathbf{r}''$
to $\mathbf{r}'$, (iii) scattering again at point $\mathbf{r}'$, and
(iv) propagation from $\mathbf{r}'$ to $\mathbf{r}$.  Note that
$\mathbf{r}'$ and $\mathbf{r}''$ are integrated over all possible
positions.  Since the integrals are weighted by $V$, the positions
with the strongest scattering potential contribute the most.

For a sufficiently weak scatterer, it is often a good approximation to
retain just the first few terms in the Born series.  The question of
when $\hat{V}$ is ``sufficiently weak''---i.e., when the Born series
converges---is a complex topic beyond the scope of our present
discussion.

## Green's function for a free particle

In the position basis representation of the Born series,
Eq.~\eqref{Bornposition}, a crucial role is played by the matrix
elements $\langle\mathbf{r}|\hat{G}_0|\mathbf{r}'\rangle$.  We call
this the \textbf{propagator}, as it describes how the particle
propagates between discrete scattering events.

Starting from the definition of $\hat{G}_0$ in
Eq.~\eqref{G0unregulated}, we can evaluate it in the position basis:

$$\begin{aligned}
\langle\mathbf{r} |\big(E-\hat{H}_0\big) \hat{G}_0 |\mathbf{r}'\rangle &= \langle\mathbf{r}|\hat{I}|\mathbf{r}'\rangle \\
= \left(E + \frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 \right) \langle\mathbf{r} |\hat{G}_0 |\mathbf{r}'\rangle &= \delta^d(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}')
\end{aligned}$$

Hence,

$$\left(\nabla^2 + k^2\right) \langle\mathbf{r} |\hat{G}_0 |\mathbf{r}'\rangle = \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \delta^d(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'),$$

where

$$k^2 = \frac{2mE}{\hbar^2}.$$

The left side of this equation is the same as the $d$-dimensional
Helmholtz equation, with the $\nabla^2$ acting on the $\mathbf{r}$
coordinates (not $\mathbf{r}'$).  On the right side, we have a term
proportional to a $d$-dimensional delta function at $\mathbf{r} =
\mathbf{r}'$.  The propagator thus describes a wave at each position
$\mathbf{r}$, emitted from a point source at $\mathbf{r}'$.

Eq.~\eqref{propagatoreq} can be solved analytically for different
values of the spatial dimension $d$.  In the following, we will work
through the derivation for $d = 3$.  The derivations for $d = 1$ and
$d = 2$ are left as exercises.

To derive the 3D propagator, we first re-express it using the momentum
eigenbasis:

$$\begin{aligned}
\langle\mathbf{r}|\hat{G}_0|\mathbf{r}'\rangle
&= \langle\mathbf{r}|\hat{G}_0 \Big(\int d^3k'\; |\mathbf{k}'\rangle\langle\mathbf{k}'| \Big) |\mathbf{r}'\rangle \nonumber \\
&= \int d^3k' \; \langle\mathbf{r}|\mathbf{k}'\rangle \;
\frac{1}{E-\frac{\hbar^2|\mathbf{k}'|^2}{2m}} \;
\langle\mathbf{k}'|\mathbf{r}'\rangle \nonumber \\
&= \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \frac{1}{(2\pi)^3} \int d^3k' \;
\frac{\exp\left[i\mathbf{k}' \cdot
(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}')\right]}{k^2-|\mathbf{k}'|^2}.\end{aligned}$$

Next, we express $\mathbf{k}'$ using spherical coordinates
$(k',\theta,\phi)$.  We are free to choose the $\theta=0$ axis so that
it points in the direction of $\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'$, as illustrated
below:

<!-- \begin{figure}[h] -->
<!-- \centering\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{spherical_coords} -->
<!-- \end{figure} -->

Then,

$$\begin{aligned}
\langle\mathbf{r}|\hat{G}_0|\mathbf{r}'\rangle &= \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \frac{1}{(2\pi)^3} \int d^3k' \; \frac{\exp\left[i\mathbf{k}'\cdot (\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}')\right]}{k^2-|\mathbf{k}'|^2} \nonumber \\
&= \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \frac{1}{(2\pi)^3} \int_0^\infty dk' \int_0^\pi d\theta \int_{0}^{2\pi} d\phi \;{k'}^{2}\sin\theta\; \frac{\displaystyle \exp\left(ik'|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|\cos\theta\right)}{k^2-{k'}^2} \nonumber \\
&= \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \frac{1}{(2\pi)^2} \int_0^\infty dk' \int_{-1}^1 d\mu \;{k'}^2\; \frac{\displaystyle \exp\left(ik'|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|\mu\right)}{k^2-{k'}^2} \qquad(\text{letting}\;\mu = \cos\theta) \nonumber \\
&= \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \frac{1}{(2\pi)^2} \int_0^\infty dk' \; \frac{ {k'}^2}{k^2-{k'}^2}\, \frac{\displaystyle \exp\left(ik'|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|\right) - \exp\left(-ik'|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|\right)}{ik'|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|} \nonumber\\
&= \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \frac{1}{(2\pi)^2} \frac{i}{|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|} \int_{-\infty}^\infty dk' \; \frac{\displaystyle k'\, \exp\left(ik'|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|\right)}{(k' - k)(k'+k)}.\end{aligned}$$

This looks like something we can handle via contour integration.  But
there's a snag: the integration contour runs over the real $k'$ line,
but since $k \in \mathbb{R}^+$ the poles at $\pm k$ lie on the
contour.  The integral, as currently defined, is singular.

To get a finite result, we must regularize the integral by adjusting
its definition.  One way is to perturb the integrand and shift its
poles infinitesimally in the complex plane, moving them off the
contour.  We have a choice of whether to move each pole
infinitesimally up or down.  It turns out that the appropriate choice
is to shift the pole at $-k$ down, and shift the pole at $+k$ up, as
illustrated by the red dots in the following figure:

<!-- \begin{figure}[h!] -->
<!-- \centering\includegraphics[width=0.34\textwidth]{greencontour} -->
<!-- \end{figure} -->

This alters the denominator in the integrand of
Eq.~\eqref{rGrintegrand} as follows:

$$(k' - k)(k'+k) \;\rightarrow\; (k' - k - i\epsilon)(k'+k+i\epsilon) = {k'}^2 - (k+i\epsilon)^2,$$

where $\epsilon$ is a positive infinitesimal.  The implications of
this adjustment will be discussed further below.  For now, let us
proceed to do the integral, which is no longer divergent:

$$\begin{aligned}\int_{-\infty}^\infty dk' \; \frac{\displaystyle k' \exp\left(ik'|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|\right)}{(k' - k)(k'+k)} &\rightarrow \lim_{\varepsilon \rightarrow 0^+} \int_{-\infty}^\infty dk' \; \frac{\displaystyle k' \exp\left(ik'|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|\right)}{(k' - k - i\varepsilon)(k'+k+i\varepsilon)}\;\;\; (\text{regularize}) \\ &= \lim_{\varepsilon \rightarrow 0^+} \int_C dk' \; \frac{\displaystyle k' \exp\left(ik'|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|\right)}{(k' - k - i\varepsilon)(k'+k+i\varepsilon)} \quad\;\;\; (\text{close contour above}) \\ &= 2\pi i \lim_{\varepsilon \rightarrow 0^+} \mathrm{Res}\left[\frac{\displaystyle k' \exp\left(ik'|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|\right)}{(k' - k - i\varepsilon)(k'+k+i\varepsilon)}, \;k'=k+i\varepsilon^+\right] \\ &= \pi i \exp\left(ik|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|\right).\end{aligned}$$

Finally, plugging this into Eq.~\eqref{rGrintegrand} gives the result

$$\langle\mathbf{r}|\hat{G}_0|\mathbf{r}'\rangle = -\frac{2m}{\hbar^2}
\cdot \frac{\exp\left(ik|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|\right)}{4\pi|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|}.$$

The 3D propagator \eqref{3dprop} describes a spherical wave centered
at the source $\mathbf{r}'$.  The wave is isotropic (i.e., independent
of the direction of $\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}'$), consistent with the
fact that the source, a delta function, has no preferred direction.
The amplitude of the wave decreases inversely with $\Delta r =
|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|$, consistent with flux conservation in 3D.

Most importantly, the wave propagates \textit{outward} from
$\mathbf{r}'$ (since the phase of the wavefunction increases with
$\Delta r$).  Such a propagator is said to be \textbf{causal}, a word
based on the term ``cause and effect''---the wave travels from the
source at $\mathbf{r}'$ (the \textit{cause}) to $\mathbf{r}$ (the
\textit{effect}).  We can trace this behavior back to the
regularization in Eq.~\eqref{kregularization}; other regularization
choices can be shown to yield propagators with different properties
(see \hyperref[ex:anticausal]{exercises}).  Our regularization
\eqref{kregularization} can also be expressed as an infinitesimal
shift in $E$, via Eq.~\eqref{keq}:

$$\frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m} = E
\;\;\;\Rightarrow\;\;\;
\frac{\hbar^2 (k+i\epsilon)^2}{2m}
= \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \left(k^2 + 2ik\epsilon + \cdots\right)
= E + i\varepsilon.$$

In other words, we have swapped the original definition of the Green's
function, Eq.~\eqref{G0unregulated}, for a **causal Green's
function**

$$\hat{G_0} = \lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow 0^+} \big(E - \hat{H}_0 + i \varepsilon\big)^{-1}.$$

Based on Eq.~\eqref{G0regulated}, causal propagators can also be
derived for other dimensions.  The results for $d = 1, 2,$
and $3$ are summarized below:

$$\langle\mathbf{r}|\hat{G}_0|\mathbf{r}'\rangle = \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \times \begin{cases} \Bigg.\displaystyle\frac{1}{2ik} \exp\left(ik|x-x'|\right),& d=1\\ \Bigg. \displaystyle\frac{1}{4i} H^+_0(k|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'}|), & d=2 \\ \displaystyle \Bigg. - \frac{\exp\left(ik|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|\right)}{4\pi|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|}, & d = 3.  \end{cases}$$

For each $d$, the causal propagator describes a wave propagating
outward isotropically from $\mathbf{r}'$.  In 1D, this has the form of
a plane wave on each side. In 2D, it is a circular wave ($H_0^+$
denotes a Hankel function; see Appendix A), and in 3D it is a
spherical wave.

## Scattering amplitudes in 3D

We are now in a position to generate explicit solutions for the
scattering problem by combining the results of
Sections~\ref{sec:scattering_amplitude}--\ref{sec:freegreen}.  For
ease of presentation, we will focus on the 3D case; the 1D and 2D
cases are handled in a similar way.

Using Eqs.~\eqref{psiscat} and \eqref{psis_useful}, we can write the
scattered wavefunction as

$$\psi_s(\mathbf{r})
= \langle\mathbf{r}|
\hat{G}_0 \hat{V}
\underbrace{\big(\hat{I} + \hat{G} \hat{V}\big) |\psi_i\rangle}_{= |\psi\rangle}
\\
\;\; \overset{r\rightarrow\infty}{\longrightarrow}\;\;
\Psi_i \, \frac{e^{ikr}}{r} \, f(\mathbf{k}_i\rightarrow k\hat{\mathbf{r}}).$$

We want to use this to find the scattering amplitude $f$, which
encodes the results of the scattering experiment in the large-$r$
limit (see Sec.~\ref{sec:scattering_amplitude}).

Let us work on the expression on the left first.  Using the position
representation,

$$\begin{aligned}
\psi_s(\mathbf{r}) = \int d^3r'\; \langle\mathbf{r}|\hat{G}_0|\mathbf{r}'\rangle\, V(\mathbf{r}')\, \langle \mathbf{r}'| \big(\hat{I} + \hat{G} \hat{V}\big) |\psi_i\rangle.\end{aligned}$$

From Eq.~\eqref{propagator_solutions}, the causal propagator in 3D is

$$\langle\mathbf{r}|\hat{G}_0|\mathbf{r}'\rangle =
- \frac{2m}{\hbar^2}
\frac{\exp\left(ik|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|\right)}{4\pi|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|}.$$

In the $r\rightarrow\infty$ limit, this can be simplified using the
Taylor expansion

$$|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}'| = r - \hat{\mathbf{r}} \cdot \mathbf{r}' + \cdots,$$

where $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ is the unit vector pointing parallel to
$\mathbf{r}$.  (This is the same large-$r$ expansion used to derive
the electric dipole moment in classical electromagnetism.)  Hence, to
lowest order,

$$\langle\mathbf{r}|\hat{G}_0|\mathbf{r}'\rangle \overset{r\rightarrow\infty}{\longrightarrow} - \frac{2m}{\hbar^2}\, \frac{e^{ikr}}{4\pi r}\; \exp\left(-ik \, \hat{\mathbf{r}} \cdot \mathbf{r}'\right).$$

Applying this to Eq.~\eqref{psis_positionrep} gives

$$\begin{aligned}\psi_s(\mathbf{r})
&\overset{r\rightarrow\infty}{\longrightarrow} \, - \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \, \frac{e^{ikr}}{4\pi r}\; \int d^3r' \exp\left(-ik \, \hat{\mathbf{r}} \cdot \mathbf{r}'\right)\, V(\mathbf{r}')\,
\langle \mathbf{r}'| \big(\hat{I} + \hat{G} \hat{V}\big) |\psi_i\rangle \\
&\;\;=\;\; - \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \, \frac{e^{ikr}}{r} \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}} \; \big\langle \mathbf{k}_f \big|\hat{V} + \hat{V} \hat{G} \hat{V}
\big|\psi_i\big\rangle. \end{aligned}$$

On the second line, we simplified the expression by introducing the
momentum eigenstate with $\mathbf{k}_f \equiv k \hat{\mathbf{r}}$.
This corresponds to the ``final'' momentum of the scattered particle,
measured when the particle is picked up by a detector placed in the
$\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ direction relative to the origin.  Note that
$|\mathbf{k}_f| = |\mathbf{k}_i| = k$, consistent with elastic
scattering.  Similarly, we can express the incident state in terms of
a momentum eigenstate, by comparing Eqs.~\eqref{kwavefun} to
\eqref{psiin}:

$$|\psi_i\rangle = \Psi_i (2\pi)^{3/2} |\mathbf{k}_i\rangle.$$

Thus, Eq.~\eqref{psis_intermediate} becomes

$$\begin{aligned}\psi_s(\mathbf{r}) \; &\overset{r\rightarrow\infty}{\longrightarrow} - \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \, \Psi_i\, \frac{e^{ikr}}{r} \; 2\pi^2 \; \big\langle \mathbf{k}_f \big|\hat{V} + \hat{V}\hat{G}\hat{V}\big|\mathbf{k}_i\big\rangle.\end{aligned}$$

Comparing this to the right side of Eq.~\eqref{psis_expansion}, we can
read off the scattering amplitude:

$$\begin{aligned}
f(\mathbf{k}_i \rightarrow \mathbf{k}_f) &= - \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \,\cdot \, 2\pi^2 \; \big\langle \mathbf{k}_f\big| \hat{V} + \hat{V}\hat{G} \hat{V} \big|\mathbf{k}_i\big\rangle \\
&= - \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \,\cdot \, 2\pi^2 \; \big\langle \mathbf{k}_f\big| \hat{V} + \hat{V}\hat{G}_0 \hat{V} + \hat{V} \hat{G}_0 \hat{V} \hat{G}_0\hat{V} + \cdots \big|\mathbf{k}_i\big\rangle.  \end{aligned}$$

As noted above, this result is subject to the elasticity constraint
$|\mathbf{k}_i| = |\mathbf{k}_f|$.  To get the infinite series on the
second line of Eq.~\eqref{fresult}, we have used
Eq.~\eqref{bornseries}.

Eq.~\eqref{fresult} is the culmination of numerous definitions and
derivations from the preceding sections.  On the left side is the
scattering amplitude, the fundamental quantity of interest in a
scattering experiment.  The right side contains the various inputs to
the scattering problem: the initial and final momenta, the scattering
potential, and the Green's function.  Although this result was derived
for the 3D case, very similar formulas hold for other dimensions, with
the $2\pi^2$ factor replaced with other numerical factors.

### Example: uniform spherical well in 3D

Let us test the Born series with a simple scatterer.  Consider a
scattering potential that consists of a uniform spherical well of
depth $U > 0$ and radius $R$:

$$V(\mathbf{r}) = \begin{cases}-U, & |\mathbf{r}| \le R \\ \;\;\;\,0,
& |\mathbf{r}| > 0. \end{cases}$$

As it turns out, this particular scattering problem can be solved
exactly by exploiting the spherical symmetry of $V(\mathbf{r})$.  The
solution method, called \textbf{partial wave analysis}, is explained
in Appendix A.  Its result is

$$\begin{aligned}f(\mathbf{k}_i \rightarrow \mathbf{k}_f) &= \frac{1}{2ik}\, \sum_{\ell =0}^\infty \big(e^{2i\delta_\ell} - 1\big) \big(2\ell+1\big)\, P_{\ell}(\hat{\mathbf{k}}_i\cdot \hat{\mathbf{k}}_f), \\ \mathrm{where}\;\; \delta_\ell &= \frac{\pi}{2} + \mathrm{arg}\!\left[k {h_\ell^+}'(kR) \, j_\ell(qR) - qh_\ell^+(kR)\, j_\ell'(qR)\right], \\ q &= \sqrt{2m(E+U)/\hbar^2} \\ k &\equiv |\mathbf{k}_i| = |\mathbf{k}_f|.\end{aligned}$$

The solution is expressed in terms of the special functions $j_\ell$
(spherical Bessel function of the first kind), $h_\ell^+$ (spherical
Hankel function of the first kind), and $P_\ell$ (Legendre
polynomial).

We will pit this against the Born series, which can be regarded as a
more general method since it does not assume spherical symmetry.
According to Eq.~\eqref{fresult}, the Born series gives

$$f(\mathbf{k}_i\rightarrow \mathbf{k}_f) = - \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \,\cdot \, 2\pi^2 \, \left[\big\langle \mathbf{k}_f\big| \hat{V}|\mathbf{k}_i\big\rangle + \big\langle \mathbf{k}_f \big| \hat{V}\hat{G}_0 \hat{V} \big|\mathbf{k}_i\big\rangle + \cdots \right].$$

Evaluating the full infinite Born series is generally an intractable
problem, but we can truncate it to get an approximation for $f$.  For
example, if we keep only the first term, the result is called the
\textbf{first Born approximation}; if we keep only the first two
terms, we obtain the \textbf{second Born approximation}.  To evaluate
the various bra-kets, we can use the position representation to
express them as explicit integrals.  For example,

$$\begin{aligned}
\big\langle \mathbf{k}_f\big| \hat{V}|\mathbf{k}_i\big\rangle
&= \int d^3r_1\; \frac{\exp(-i\mathbf{k}_f \cdot \mathbf{r}_1)}{(2\pi)^{3/2}} \, V(\mathbf{r}_1) \, \frac{\exp(i\mathbf{k}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_1)}{(2\pi)^{3/2}}
 \\
&= - \frac{U}{8\pi^3} \int_{|\mathbf{r}_1| \le R} d^3r_1 \; \exp\left[i(\mathbf{k}_i-\mathbf{k}_f)\, \cdot\, \mathbf{r}_1\right] \label{singleint}\\
\big\langle \mathbf{k}_f \big| \hat{V}\hat{G}_0 \hat{V} \big|\mathbf{k}_i\big\rangle &=
\int d^3r_1 \!\! \int d^3r_2 \; \frac{\exp(-i\mathbf{k}_f \cdot \mathbf{r}_2)}{(2\pi)^{3/2}} \, V(\mathbf{r}_2) \, \langle\mathbf{r}_2|\hat{G}_0|\mathbf{r}_1 \rangle \, V(\mathbf{r}_1)\, \frac{\exp(i\mathbf{k}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_1)}{(2\pi)^{3/2}} \\
&= - \frac{U^2}{32\pi^4} \, \frac{2m}{\hbar^2}\, \int_{|\mathbf{r}_1|<R} d^3 r_1 \int_{|\mathbf{r}_2|<R} d^3 r_2 \; \frac{\exp\left[i(k|\mathbf{r}_1-\mathbf{r}_2| - \mathbf{k}_f \cdot \mathbf{r}_2 +\mathbf{k}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_1)\right]}{|\mathbf{r}_1-\mathbf{r}_2|}.
\end{aligned}$$

To evaluate the integrals, an expedient approach is Monte Carlo
integration.  For instance, the integral \eqref{singleint} has the
form

$$I = \int_{|\mathrm{r}|<R} d^3r \, F(\mathbf{r}).$$

To compute this, we randomly sample $N$ points within a cube of volume
$(2R)^3$ centered at the origin.  Note that this cube encloses the
radius-$R$ sphere over which is the integration region.  For each
sampled point, $\mathbf{r}^{(n)}$, we take

$$F_n = \begin{cases}F(\mathbf{r}^{(n)}), & |\mathbf{r}^{(n)}| < R \\ 0, &\mathrm{otherwise},\end{cases}$$

which drops contributions from points outside the sphere.  Then our
estimate for $I$ is

$$I \,\approx\, (2R)^3 \, \langle F_n\rangle \,=\, \frac{(2R)^3}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N F_n.$$

The estimate converges to the true value as $N\rightarrow\infty$.  In
practice, $N \sim 10^4$ yields a good result for typical 3D integrals,
and can be calculated in seconds on a modern computer.

Similarly, to calculate a double integral like Eq.~\eqref{doubleint},
we sample \textit{pairs} of points, $(\mathbf{r}_1^{(n)},
\mathbf{r}_2^{(n)})$, and replace the volume factor $(2R)^3$ in
Eq.~\eqref{Iest} with $(2R)^6$.  The rest of the estimation procedure
is the same.

The figure below compares the Born approximation to the exact solution
\eqref{fresult_well} for two well depths, $U = 0.1$ and $U = 1$, with
the same radius $R = 1$.  We plot $|f|^2$ versus $E$ at a $90^\circ$
scattering angle (i.e., $\mathbf{k}_f$ perpendicular to
$\mathbf{k}_i$), using computational units $\hbar = m = 1$.  Each
Monte Carlo integral is computed using $3\times10^4$ samples.

<!-- \begin{figure}[h] -->
<!-- \centering\includegraphics[width=0.97\textwidth]{spherical_well_scattering} -->
<!-- \end{figure} -->

First, notice that $|f|^2$ diminishes to zero for large $E$.  This
makes sense: the scattering potential has some energy scale $\sim U$,
so a particle with energy $E \gg U$ should simply zoom through, with
little chance of being deflected.

Looking more closely, we see that for the shallower well ($U = 0.1$),
the first Born approximation already agrees quite well with the exact
results.  However, the second Born approximation is significantly more
accurate, particularly for small $E$.

For the deeper well ($U = 1$), neither the first nor second Born
approximations do a good job.  Roughly speaking, for the deep
potential well, we cannot neglect multiple-scattering events
represented by higher terms in the Born series, whereby the particle
bounces around many times before leaving the scatterer (see
Sec.~\ref{sec:greensfun}).

In fact, for very strong scattering potentials, even taking the Born
approximation to high orders may not work, as the Born series may
become non-convergent.  In such cases, different methods must be
brought to bear.  We will see an example in the next chapter.

## Exercises

1. In Sec.~\ref{sec:waves}, we derived the eigenstates of a
particle in an empty infinite space by considering a box of length
$L$ on each side, applying periodic boundary conditions, and taking
$L \rightarrow \infty$.  Suppose we instead use Dirichlet boundary
conditions (i.e., the wavefunction vanishes on the walls of the
box).  Show that this gives rise to the same set of momentum
eigenstates in the $L \rightarrow \infty$ limit.

2. Using the results for the 1D delta-function scattering problem
described in Section~\ref{sec:1dscatter}, calculate the probability
current

$$J(x) = \frac{\hbar}{2mi}\left(\psi^*\frac{d\psi}{dx} - \psi\frac{d\psi^*}{dx}\right),$$

where $\psi(x)$ is the \textit{total} (incident + scattered)
wavefunction.  Explain the relationship between the values of $J$ on
the left and right side of the scatterer.

3. Derive the causal 1D propagator:

$$\langle x|\hat{G}_0|x'\rangle = \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \cdot \frac{1}{2ik_i} \exp\left(ik_i|x-x'|\right).$$

4. Derive the causal 2D propagator:

$$\langle\mathbf{r}|\hat{G}_0|\mathbf{r}'\rangle = \frac{2m}{\hbar^2}\;
\frac{1}{4i} H^+_0(k|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'}|).$$

You should be able to adapt many of the steps in the 3D propagator
derivation from Section~\ref{sec:freegreen}.  When evaluating the
polar integral, you may want to refer to the discussion of Bessel
and Hankel functions in Appendix A.  You may also need the following
mathematical identity between the Hankel functions:

$$H_m^+(z) = - (-1)^m \, H_m^-(-z).$$

5. In place of the causal Green's function defined in
Eq.~\eqref{G0regulated}, consider an infinitesimal shift of the
opposite sign:

$$\hat{G_0} = \lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow 0^+} \big(E - \hat{H}_0 - i \varepsilon\big)^{-1}.$$

  A. Whereas the causal propagators in Eq.~\eqref{propagator_solutions}
represent outgoing waves, explain why Eq.~\eqref{G0anticausal} will
give rise to propagators representing incoming waves.

  B.  In the derivation of the 3D propagator,
Eqs.~\eqref{rGr}--\eqref{3dprop}, show mathematically how
Eq.~\eqref{G0anticausal} changes the contour integration, resulting
in an incoming-wave solution.

6. In Section~\ref{sec:3damp}, the scattering amplitude
$f(\mathrm{k}\rightarrow\mathrm{k}')$ for the 3D scattering problem
was derived using the Born series.  Derive the corresponding
expressions for 1D and 2D.
