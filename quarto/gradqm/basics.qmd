# Basics of Quantum Theory

Quantum theory, or quantum mechanics, is the fundamental physical
framework describing all objects of microscopic size---and, so far as
we know, larger objects too.  It was developed, in fits and starts,
over several decades in the first half of the 20th century, beginning
with [Max Planck's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Planck) 1900
proposal that the energy in radiation is packaged into discrete
"quanta", and approaching its modern form with the formulation of wave
mechanics
by
[Erwin Schrödinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Schr%C3%B6dinger) in
1926 and matrix mechanics
by
[Werner Heisenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Heisenberg)
in 1928.  The mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics most
physicists use today is based on the **Dirac–von Neumann axioms**, put
together in the 1930s
by [Paul Dirac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Dirac)
and
[John von Neumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann),
which unifies and systematizes the Schrödinger and Heisenberg theories
using the mathematical language of linear algebra.

In this chapter, we review the basic principles of the theory.
This is a summary, not a pedagogical introduction; the reader is
assumed to possess some familiarity with quantum mechanics, based on
prior reading or coursework.

## States and Observables

The central idea underlying quantum theory is that there is a
distinction between **states** and **observables**.  A state describes
*how a system currently is*, while observables represent its
*measurable properties*.  In classical physics, a state may be defined
by a complete set of observables: for instance, if we know the
position and momentum of a point particle of given mass, then we know
everything about it, including the values of all other observables
(energy, orbital angular momentum, etc.).  Quantum theory, however,
draws a bright line between the two concepts.

The Dirac–von Neumann axiomatization of quantum mechanics starts with
the following postulates:

1. A system's state is a vector $|\psi\rangle \in \mathscr{H}$, where
  $\mathscr{H}$ is a complex Hilbert space.^[A Hilbert space is a
  vector space with an inner product, plus the property of
  "completeness".  Completeness means, roughly, that infinite
  series are well-defined: if we construct a convergent infinite sum
  of vectors from $\mathscr{H}$, the result remains in
  $\mathscr{H}$.  By analogy, consider the Leibniz series for $\pi$:
  $$\pi = 4\left(1-\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{5} - \cdots\right).$$  The series on
  the right can be constructed entirely from rational numbers, but the
  result is irrational.  By contrast, the set of real numbers
  $\mathbb{R}$ is complete---a convergent infinite series of reals
  remains in $\mathbb{R}$.  The Hilbert space concept applies the same
  property to vectors.]  The choice of Hilbert space, including
  its dimension, is system-specific.

2. An observable is a linear operator, $\hat{A}$, acting on state
  vectors.  This operator is Hermitian, or self-adjoint: $\hat{A} =
  \hat{A}^{\dagger}$.  The eigenvalues correspond to the observable's
  possible measurement results, and the associated eigenvectors are
  called **eigenstates**.

To operationalize these concepts, two further postulates are
introduced:

3. **The Schrödinger equation**---The time-dependence of a system's
   state, $|\psi(t)\rangle$, is determined by an observable called the
   **Hamiltonian**, $\hat{H}$, according to
   $$i\hbar \frac{d}{dt}|\psi(t)\rangle = \hat{H}(t) \, |\psi(t)\rangle.$$
   Note that the Hamiltonian itself may be time-dependent.

4. **The measurement postulate**---If an observable $\hat{A}$ is measured
   on a state $|\psi(t)\rangle$, the result is drawn probabilistically
   from one of the eigenvalues $\{a_n\}$.  The probability to obtain a
   result $a_n$, which corresponds to an eigenstate $|n\rangle$, is
   $$P_n = |\langle n|\psi\rangle|^2.$$
   Afterwards, the system's state instantly switches to the eigenstate
   $|n\rangle$ matching the measurement outcome.  This is called
   **state collapse**.

From these postulates flow all the celebrated successes of quantum
theory, which underlies our modern understanding of chemistry,
materials science, nuclear physics, etc.  Many pieces of modern
technology that we rely on everyday, like lasers, LEDs, and computers,
are built upon *quantitative* calculations enabled by quantum theory.
Despite these successes, however, it is possible to spot a couple of
problems lurking in the postulates:

* In postulate 3, the Schrödinger equation gives a privileged role to
  the time variable $t$.  This seems to run counter to (i) special
  relativity's demands that time and space be treated on equal
  footing, and (ii) general relativity's demands that time (and space)
  be dynamical quantities. The first conflict can be resolved by a
  class of quantum theories called quantum field theories, but the
  second remains unresolved.  This theoretical difficulty has a cool
  name: it is called the [problem of
  time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_time).

* There is a tension between postulates 3 and 4.  Postulate 3
  describes the state evolving smoothly according to a
  *deterministic* differential equation (the Schrödinger equation).
  However, postulate 4 describes a *probabilitic* jump to another
  state, occurring abruptly when a measurement is performed.  Thus,
  the act of measurement seems to play a special role in quantum
  mechanics.  This has surprising (and possibly troubling)
  consequences, as we shall see in @sec-chapter-entanglement.

In the remainder of this chapter, we will use the quantum postulates
to develop a few simple but important theoretical models: two-level
systems, particles on lattices, and wavefunctions.

## Wavefunctions

### Position eigenstates
Before proceeding, let us review the properties of a quantum particle
in free space.  In a $d$-dimensional space, a coordinate vector
$\mathbf{r}$ is a real vector with $d$ components.  We suppose there
is a uncountably infinite set of position eigenstates,
$\{|\mathbf{r}\rangle\}$, where each $|\mathbf{r}\rangle$ describes a
particle with a definite position $\mathbf{r}$.  The position
eigenstates are assumed to span the state space, such that the
identity operator can be resolved as

$$\hat{I} = \int d^dr \, |\mathbf{r}\rangle \langle\mathbf{r}|,$$

with the integral is taken over all allowed $\mathbf{r}$ (e.g.,
$\mathbf{r} \in \mathbb{R}^d$).  It follows that

$$\langle \mathbf{r} | \mathbf{r}' \rangle = \delta^d(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}').$$

Thus, we say that the position eigenstates are *delta-normalized*,
rather than being normalized to unity.  Here $\delta^d(\cdots)$
denotes the $d$-dimensional delta function; e.g., in 2D,

$$\langle x,y \,|\, x',y' \rangle = \delta(x-x') \, \delta(y-y').$$

Moreover, the position operator $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ is defined such
that $\hat{\mathbf{r}} |\mathbf{r}\rangle \,=\, \mathbf{r}\,
|\mathbf{r}\rangle$.

### Momentum eigenstates{#sec-momentum-eigenstates}

Momentum eigenstates are constructed from position eigenstates via
Fourier transforms.  First, let us suppose $\mathbf{r}$ runs over a
finite box of length $L$ on each side, with periodic boundary
conditions.  For plane waves of the form
$\exp(i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r})$, where $\mathbf{k} = (k_1, \dots,
k_d)$ is the wave-vector, the periodic boundary conditions are
satisfied if and only if

$$k_j = 2\pi m/L\;\;\mathrm{for} \;m\in\mathbb{Z}.$$

Note that the set of allowed wave-vectors is discrete (i.e.,
countable), with a discretization of $\Delta k = 2\pi/L$ in each
direction.  Next, define

$$|\mathbf{k}\rangle = \frac{1}{L^{d/2}} \, \int d^dr \; e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}} |\mathbf{r}\rangle,$$

where the integral is taken over the box.  We identify
$|\mathbf{k}\rangle$ as a momentum eigenstate, i.e., a state with
definite momentum $\hbar \mathbf{k}$.  We can now show
that

$$\langle\mathbf{k}|\mathbf{k}'\rangle = \delta_{\mathbf{k},\mathbf{k}'}, \quad \langle\mathbf{r}|\mathbf{k}\rangle = \frac{1}{L^{d/2}} e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}}, \quad I = \sum_{\mathbf{k}} |\mathbf{k}\rangle\,\langle\mathbf{k}|.$$

In particular, note that each momentum eigenstate is normalizable to
unity.

Now let us take $L \rightarrow \infty$.  In this limit, the
wave-vector discretization $\Delta k = 2\pi / L$ goes to zero, so the
momentum eigenvalues coalesce into a continuum.  To handle this, we
redefine the momentum eigenstates as

$$|\mathbf{k}\rangle^{(\textrm{new})} = \left(\frac{L}{2\pi}\right)^{d/2} |\mathbf{k}\rangle^{(\textrm{old})}.$$

Then, by using the formula

$$\int_{-\infty}^\infty dx\; \exp(ikx) \;=\; 2\pi\, \delta(k),$$

we can show that the new momentum eigenstates are related to the
position eigenstates by

$$\begin{aligned}
  |\mathbf{k}\rangle &= \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{d/2}} \, \int d^dr \; e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}} |\mathbf{r}\rangle, \\
  |\mathbf{r}\rangle &= \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{d/2}} \, \int d^dk \; e^{-i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}} |\mathbf{k}\rangle. \end{aligned}$$
  
Position and momentum are now treated on similar footing, with the
integrals over $\mathbf{r}$ and $\mathbf{k}$ both taken over infinite
spaces.  Moreover, the momentum eigenstates now satisfy

$$\begin{aligned}
  I &= \int d^dk \;|\mathbf{k}\rangle\,\langle\mathbf{k}|, \label{Iresolk} \\
  \langle\mathbf{k}|\mathbf{k}'\rangle &= \delta^d(\mathbf{k}-\mathbf{k}'), \\
  \langle\mathbf{r}|\mathbf{k}\rangle &= \frac{e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}}}{(2\pi)^{d/2}}.\end{aligned}$$
  
The first two equations are analogous to their position eigenstate
counterparts.  In particular, the new $|\mathbf{k}\rangle$'s are
delta-normalized.  The last equation can be interpreted as the
wavefunction of the delta-normalized momentum eigenstate.

The momentum operator $\hat{\mathbf{p}}$ is defined using the
$|\mathbf{k}\rangle$'s as the eigenbasis:

$$ \hat{\mathbf{p}} |\mathbf{k}\rangle \,=\, \hbar \mathbf{k}\,
|\mathbf{k}\rangle.$$

For any quantum state $|\psi\rangle$, whose wavefunction is
$\psi(\mathbf{r}) = \langle \mathbf{r}|\psi\rangle$, we can show that
the momentum operator acts on wavefunctions in the following way:

$$\begin{aligned}\langle \mathbf{r}|\hat{\mathbf{p}}|\psi\rangle
  &= \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{d/2}} \, \int d^dk \; e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}} \langle \mathbf{k} | \hat{\mathbf{p}} | \psi\rangle \\
  &= \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{d/2}} \, \int d^dk \; \hbar\mathbf{k} \, e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}} \langle \mathbf{k} | \psi\rangle \\
  &= -i \hbar\nabla \left[\frac{1}{(2\pi)^{d/2}} \, \int d^dk \, e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}} \langle \mathbf{k} | \psi\rangle \right] \\
  &= -i\hbar \nabla\psi(\mathbf{r}).
  \end{aligned}$$

## Exercises

1. In @sec-momentum-eigenstates, we derived the eigenstates of a
particle in an empty infinite space by considering a box of length
$L$ on each side, applying periodic boundary conditions, and taking
$L \rightarrow \infty$.  Suppose we instead use Dirichlet boundary
conditions (i.e., the wavefunction vanishes on the walls of the
box).  Show that this gives rise to the same set of momentum
eigenstates in the $L \rightarrow \infty$ limit.
