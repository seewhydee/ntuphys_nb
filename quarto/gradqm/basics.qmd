# Basics of Quantum Theory

Quantum theory, or quantum mechanics, is the fundamental physical
framework that describes all objects of microscopic size---and, so far as
we know, larger objects too.  It was developed, in fits and starts,
over several decades in the first half of the 20th century, beginning
with [Max Planck's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Planck) 1900
proposal that the energy in radiation is packaged into discrete
"quanta", and approaching its modern form with the formulation of wave
mechanics
by
[Erwin Schrödinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Schr%C3%B6dinger) in
1926 and matrix mechanics
by
[Werner Heisenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Heisenberg)
in 1928.  The mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics most
physicists use today is based on the **Dirac–von Neumann axioms**, put
together in the 1930s
by [Paul Dirac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Dirac)
and
[John von Neumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann),
which unifies and systematizes the Schrödinger and Heisenberg theories
using the mathematical language of linear algebra.

In this chapter, we review the basic principles of quantum theory.
This is a summary, not a pedagogical introduction; the reader is
assumed to possess some familiarity with quantum mechanics, based on
prior reading or coursework.

## States and Observables

The central idea that underlies quantum theory is the distinction
between **states** and **observables**.  A state describes *how a
system currently is*, while an observable represents one of its
*measurable properties*.  In classical physics, a state may be defined
by a complete set of observables: for instance, if you know the
position and momentum of a point particle of given mass, then you know
everything about it, including the values of all other observables
(energy, orbital angular momentum, etc.).  Quantum theory, however,
draws a bright line between these two concepts.

In the Dirac–von Neumann axioms,

1. A system's state is a vector $|\psi\rangle \in \mathscr{H}$, where
  $\mathscr{H}$ is a complex Hilbert space.^[A Hilbert space is a
  vector space with an inner product, plus the property of
  "completeness".  Completeness means, roughly, that infinite
  series are well-defined: if we construct a convergent infinite sum
  of vectors from $\mathscr{H}$, the result remains in
  $\mathscr{H}$.  By analogy, consider the Leibniz series for $\pi$:
  $$\pi = 4\left(1-\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{5} - \cdots\right).$$  The series on
  the right can be constructed entirely from rational numbers, but the
  result is irrational.  By contrast, the set of real numbers
  $\mathbb{R}$ is complete---a convergent infinite series of reals
  remains in $\mathbb{R}$.  The Hilbert space concept applies the same
  property to vectors.]  The choice of Hilbert space, including
  its dimension, is system-specific.

2. An observable is a linear operator, $\hat{A}$, acting on state
  vectors.  This operator is Hermitian, or self-adjoint: $\hat{A} =
  \hat{A}^{\dagger}$.

To operationalize these definitions, two further axioms are applied:

## Wavefunctions

A wavefunction is a particular type of quantum state defined as a
complex function of a continuous real variable (or variables).  Such
functions obey the usual axioms governing vectors.  For example, for
functions of a single continuous real variable $x\in\mathbb{R}$, we
can construct linear combinations

$$A_1 \psi_1(x) + A_2 \psi_2(x),$$

where $A_1, A_2 \in \mathbb{C}$.


## Position eigenstates

Before proceeding, let us review the properties of a quantum particle
in free space.  In a $d$-dimensional space, a coordinate vector
$\mathbf{r}$ is a real vector with $d$ components.  We suppose there
is a uncountably infinite set of position eigenstates,
$\{|\mathbf{r}\rangle\}$, where each $|\mathbf{r}\rangle$ describes a
particle with a definite position $\mathbf{r}$.  The position
eigenstates are assumed to span the state space, such that the
identity operator can be resolved as

$$\hat{I} = \int d^dr \, |\mathbf{r}\rangle \langle\mathbf{r}|,$$

with the integral is taken over all allowed $\mathbf{r}$ (e.g.,
$\mathbf{r} \in \mathbb{R}^d$).  It follows that

$$\langle \mathbf{r} | \mathbf{r}' \rangle = \delta^d(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}').$$

Thus, we say that the position eigenstates are *delta-normalized*,
rather than being normalized to unity.  Here $\delta^d(\cdots)$
denotes the $d$-dimensional delta function; e.g., in 2D,

$$\langle x,y \,|\, x',y' \rangle = \delta(x-x') \, \delta(y-y').$$

Moreover, the position operator $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ is defined such
that $\hat{\mathbf{r}} |\mathbf{r}\rangle \,=\, \mathbf{r}\,
|\mathbf{r}\rangle$.

## Momentum eigenstates{#sec-momentum-eigenstates}

Momentum eigenstates are constructed from position eigenstates via
Fourier transforms.  First, let us suppose $\mathbf{r}$ runs over a
finite box of length $L$ on each side, with periodic boundary
conditions.  For plane waves of the form
$\exp(i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r})$, where $\mathbf{k} = (k_1, \dots,
k_d)$ is the wave-vector, the periodic boundary conditions are
satisfied if and only if

$$k_j = 2\pi m/L\;\;\mathrm{for} \;m\in\mathbb{Z}.$$

Note that the set of allowed wave-vectors is discrete (i.e.,
countable), with a discretization of $\Delta k = 2\pi/L$ in each
direction.  Next, define

$$|\mathbf{k}\rangle = \frac{1}{L^{d/2}} \, \int d^dr \; e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}} |\mathbf{r}\rangle,$$

where the integral is taken over the box.  We identify
$|\mathbf{k}\rangle$ as a momentum eigenstate, i.e., a state with
definite momentum $\hbar \mathbf{k}$.  We can now show
that

$$\langle\mathbf{k}|\mathbf{k}'\rangle = \delta_{\mathbf{k},\mathbf{k}'}, \quad \langle\mathbf{r}|\mathbf{k}\rangle = \frac{1}{L^{d/2}} e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}}, \quad I = \sum_{\mathbf{k}} |\mathbf{k}\rangle\,\langle\mathbf{k}|.$$

In particular, note that each momentum eigenstate is normalizable to
unity.

Now let us take $L \rightarrow \infty$.  In this limit, the
wave-vector discretization $\Delta k = 2\pi / L$ goes to zero, so the
momentum eigenvalues coalesce into a continuum.  To handle this, we
redefine the momentum eigenstates as

$$|\mathbf{k}\rangle^{(\textrm{new})} = \left(\frac{L}{2\pi}\right)^{d/2} |\mathbf{k}\rangle^{(\textrm{old})}.$$

Then, by using the formula

$$\int_{-\infty}^\infty dx\; \exp(ikx) \;=\; 2\pi\, \delta(k),$$

we can show that the new momentum eigenstates are related to the
position eigenstates by

$$\begin{aligned}
  |\mathbf{k}\rangle &= \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{d/2}} \, \int d^dr \; e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}} |\mathbf{r}\rangle, \\
  |\mathbf{r}\rangle &= \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{d/2}} \, \int d^dk \; e^{-i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}} |\mathbf{k}\rangle. \end{aligned}$$
  
Position and momentum are now treated on similar footing, with the
integrals over $\mathbf{r}$ and $\mathbf{k}$ both taken over infinite
spaces.  Moreover, the momentum eigenstates now satisfy

$$\begin{aligned}
  I &= \int d^dk \;|\mathbf{k}\rangle\,\langle\mathbf{k}|, \label{Iresolk} \\
  \langle\mathbf{k}|\mathbf{k}'\rangle &= \delta^d(\mathbf{k}-\mathbf{k}'), \\
  \langle\mathbf{r}|\mathbf{k}\rangle &= \frac{e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}}}{(2\pi)^{d/2}}.\end{aligned}$$
  
The first two equations are analogous to their position eigenstate
counterparts.  In particular, the new $|\mathbf{k}\rangle$'s are
delta-normalized.  The last equation can be interpreted as the
wavefunction of the delta-normalized momentum eigenstate.

The momentum operator $\hat{\mathbf{p}}$ is defined using the
$|\mathbf{k}\rangle$'s as the eigenbasis:

$$ \hat{\mathbf{p}} |\mathbf{k}\rangle \,=\, \hbar \mathbf{k}\,
|\mathbf{k}\rangle.$$

For any quantum state $|\psi\rangle$, whose wavefunction is
$\psi(\mathbf{r}) = \langle \mathbf{r}|\psi\rangle$, we can show that
the momentum operator acts on wavefunctions in the following way:

$$\begin{aligned}\langle \mathbf{r}|\hat{\mathbf{p}}|\psi\rangle
  &= \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{d/2}} \, \int d^dk \; e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}} \langle \mathbf{k} | \hat{\mathbf{p}} | \psi\rangle \\
  &= \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{d/2}} \, \int d^dk \; \hbar\mathbf{k} \, e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}} \langle \mathbf{k} | \psi\rangle \\
  &= -i \hbar\nabla \left[\frac{1}{(2\pi)^{d/2}} \, \int d^dk \, e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}} \langle \mathbf{k} | \psi\rangle \right] \\
  &= -i\hbar \nabla\psi(\mathbf{r}).
  \end{aligned}$$

## Exercises

1. In @sec-momentum-eigenstates, we derived the eigenstates of a
particle in an empty infinite space by considering a box of length
$L$ on each side, applying periodic boundary conditions, and taking
$L \rightarrow \infty$.  Suppose we instead use Dirichlet boundary
conditions (i.e., the wavefunction vanishes on the walls of the
box).  Show that this gives rise to the same set of momentum
eigenstates in the $L \rightarrow \infty$ limit.
