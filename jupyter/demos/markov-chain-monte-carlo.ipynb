    "This demo shows off the **Markov Chain Monte Carlo Algorithm**. Originally invented in the 1950s to study thermal physics problems (e.g., why solids melt into liquids), this algorithm has proven useful in many other areas. Here, we demonstrate how to use it to break a simple cryptographic code called a Caesar cipher."

    "### How Does It Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Pick a trial solution\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by choosing a totally random cipher, called a **trial solution**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then run the encrypted message back through this cipher. If we got the right cipher, the result should be a readable English message. Most likely, however, we will get gibberish, since our randomly-chosen trial solution is very unlikely to be the right cipher. (How unlikely? The probability is one divided by the number of possible caesar ciphers, $27! \\approx 10^{28}$. You are more likely to win the TOTO jackpot one billion trillion times in a row. This also means that trying out every single possibility is unfeasible, even on a modern computer.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Determine the \"energy\" of the trial solution\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine how close the message is to a real English message, we look at the pairwise letter combinations in the message. For example, after the letter \"j\", it is much more common to encounter \"a\" than \"t\". To estimate the probabilities for all the various letter pairs, we scan real English texts. In preparation for this demo, we have previously scanned the Project Gutenberg translation of *Les Misérables* and saved it into a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "By comparing the letter combinations in the message to the probability distributions for English letter pairs, we assign a likelihood number to the trial cipher. This likelihood is interpreted as the **energy of a complex physical system**, like the molecules in a hot gas. The lower the likelihood, the higher the energy."
