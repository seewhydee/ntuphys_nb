    "## Deploying Jupyter for a class\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to run Jupyter is to run it on one's local machine. If you are using Jupyter for a class, this means requiring each student to download and install a Python environment along with the Jupyter software stack.  A simple, foolproof method is to install the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a widely-used Python distribution containing Jupyter, Scipy, and Matplotlib, which is freely available for GNU/Linux, Mac OS, and Microsoft Windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, you might not want to ask every student to install Jupyter. For instance, in my complex analysis class, I want to offer a few Jupyter notebook plots for students to play around with. But the class isn't focused on programming, and it seems overkill to ask each of the 100+ students to install the 455 MB Anaconda distribution just to interact with a few plots. For such cases, you can install Jupyter on a web server, and let the students access your notebooks over the Internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main concern regarding server deployment is security: **a Jupyter notebook can run arbitrary code on the server**.  It is very important to understand that notebook code runs on the server hosting the notebook, not the client running the web browser! So it's a very bad idea to have an unsecured Jupyter notebook that's publicly accessible over the Internet. A visitor can, in principle, use a code cell in your Jupyter notebook to run a program that exploits a privilege escalation bug to seize control of your server. \n",
    "\n",
    "To deploy Jupyter securely on a server, you can either use access control (e.g. passwords), and using containers."

    "### \"Single-user\" style access control\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter has elementary support for \"single user\" access control.  This involves having the Jupyter notebook server ask for a password before granting access.  You can let your students know the password, and tell them to visit `http://HOSTNAME:8888/notebooks/`, where `HOSTNAME` is the IP address or Internet hostname of your server. Anonymous members of the public can go that address, but without the password they won't be allowed to open a notebook to run code. But be warned---**those with the password *will* be able to run arbitrary code**, including possibly seizing control of the server. So your students need to be trusted not to do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "To deploy the Jupyter server this way, you have to specify a password and set up a SSL certification for encrypted communication.  For details, [follow the instructions here](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/public_server.html).  Also, you will need to reconfigure your firewall to open port 8888 (the port for the Jupyter notebook), and get your server a static IP address and hostname; these steps are outside the scope of the present discussion."

    "### Container deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of container deployment is to spawn a temporary virtual machine, or \"container\", for each visitor to the server. The container runs a \"fresh\" copy of a GNU/Linux operating system whose filesystem contains just your Jupyter notebooks, along with a minimal set of software (Python, Jupyter, etc.) necessary for running the notebooks. Even if a user pwns or messes up the container, the real operating system hosting the containers is unaffected. The containers are destroyed after some time (say, a few hours after creation).\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of this approach is that it is pretty tamper-proof. Even if a user (maliciously or accidentally) screws up the container, no real harm is done. A simple browser re-visit creates a new container with a fresh copy of the hosted notebooks. The disadvantage is that users won't be able to \"save\" anything to the server. If they want to retain any changes they make, they need to download a copy of the notebook to their own computer (via the menu option `File → Download as → Notebook`).\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish this, we use the [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container software, along with the code written up by the [tmpnb project](https://github.com/jupyter/tmpnb).  For the full documentation, see the [tmpnb Github page](https://github.com/jupyter/tmpnb).  Here are the basic steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a directory containing the notebooks that you want to host (along with any images needed by the notebooks, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create a file named `Dockerfile`, in that directory. This file specifies the contents of the container image that you want to host.  Here is a typical Dockerfile:<a name=\"dockerfile\"></a>"
