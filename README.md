# LaTeX and Jupyter Notes for Physics Courses

This repository contains notes and exercises for some [physics courses](http://www1.spms.ntu.edu.sg/~ydchong/teaching.html) I am teaching or have taught at [NTU](http://www.ntu.edu.sg).

## Complex Methods for the Sciences (MH2801)

This course introduces year-2 undergraduates to complex numbers and
their applications in physics and other sciences. Topics covered include:

* Complex numbers
* Complex representations of waves and oscillations
* Complex calculus (derivatives and contour integrals)
* Fourier series and Fourier transforms
* Green's functions methods.

The course notes are maintained in two different formats:

* [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) notes, located in [latex/complex](latex/complex). Compiled PDFs can be found on my [homepage](http://www1.spms.ntu.edu.sg/~ydchong/teaching.html).
* [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks, located in [jupyter/complex](jupyter/complex).

The two formats have similar contents, but the Jupyter notebooks contain interactive plots that help illustrate various mathematical concepts.

## Graduate Quantum Mechanics (PH4401/PAP777)

This course covers advanced concepts in quantum mechanics, with a focus on foundational topics required for quantum field theory. It is meant for year-4 undergraduates or year-1 graduate students who have already taken introductory courses in quantum mechanics. Topics covered include:

* Scattering theory
* Quantum entanglement
* Identical particles
* Quantum electrodynamics

The course notes are in LaTeX format, located in [latex/gradqm](latex/gradqm).

An accompanying set of [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks,
located in [jupyter/gradqm](jupyter/gradqm), provides numerical
exercises to accompany the course notes (e.g., computing the Born
series using Monte Carlo integration).

## Undergraduate Physics Laboratory (PH2198/PH2199)

Introductory physics course with an emphasis on scientific report
writing and error analysis.

A set of notes on error analysis and lab report standards are
maintained in [latex/lab](latex/lab).
