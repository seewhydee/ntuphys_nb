# LaTex and Jupyter Notes for Physics Courses

This repository contains notes and exercises for some [physics courses](http://www1.spms.ntu.edu.sg/~ydchong/teaching.html) I am teaching or have taught at [NTU](http://www.ntu.edu.sg).

## Complex Methods for the Sciences (MH2801)

This course introduces year-2 undergraduates to complex numbers and
their applications in physics and other sciences.

Topics covered include:

* Complex numbers
* Complex representations of waves and oscillations
* Complex calculus (derivatives and contour integrals)
* Fourier series and Fourier transforms
* Green's functions methods.

The course notes are maintained in two different formats:

* LaTeX notes (compiled to PDF), located in latex/gradqm
* [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks, located in jupyter/gradqm

The two formats have basically the same contents, but the Jupyter notebooks contain interactive plots that help illustrate various mathematical concepts.

## Graduate Quantum Mechanics (PH4401/PAP777)

This course covers advanced concepts in quantum mechanics, with a focus on multi-particle systems. It is meant for year-4 undergraduates or year-1 graduate students who have taken introductory courses in quantum mechanics.

Topics covered include:

* Scattering theory
* Quantum entanglement
* Identical particles
* Quantum electrodynamics

The course notes are in LaTeX format, located in latex/complex

An accompanying set of [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks
contains a set of numerical exercises to accompany the course notes
(e.g., using Monte Carlo integration to compute the Born
series). These are located in jupyter/complex

## Undergraduate Physics Laboratory (PH2198/PH2199)

Introductory physics course with an emphasis on scientific report
writing and error analysis.

A set of notes on error analysis and lab report standards are
maintained in latex/lab
