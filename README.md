# LaTeX and Jupyter Notes for Physics Courses

This repository contains notes and exercises for some [physics courses](http://www1.spms.ntu.edu.sg/~ydchong/teaching.html) I am teaching or have taught at [NTU](http://www.ntu.edu.sg).

## Complex Methods for the Sciences (MH2801)

This course introduces year-2 undergraduates to complex numbers and their applications in physics and other sciences. Topics covered include complex numbers, complex representations of waves and oscillations, complex calculus (derivatives and contour integrals), Fourier series and Fourier transforms, and Green's functions methods.

* [latex/complex](latex/complex): course notes as [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) documents. Compiled PDFs can be found on my [homepage](http://www1.spms.ntu.edu.sg/~ydchong/teaching.html).
* [jupyter/complex](jupyter/complex): course notes in [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) format, including interactive plots to help illustrate mathematical concepts.

**Book Version**: An updated and greatly-expanded version of these notes is now available in book form: [Complex Methods for Scientists and Engineers](https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/14680#t=aboutBook), published by World Scientific. The book provides more rigorous coverage of the mathematical topics, and describes many additional applications including coupled-mode theory, the propagation of light beams, diffraction, and more.

## Graduate Quantum Mechanics (PH7024)

This course covers advanced concepts in quantum mechanics, with a focus on foundational topics required for quantum field theory. It is meant for year-4 undergraduates or year-1 graduate students who have already taken introductory courses in quantum mechanics. Topics covered include scattering theory, quantum entanglement, identical particles, and quantum electrodynamics.

* [latex/gradqm](latex/gradqm): course notes in LaTeX format. Compiled PDFs can be found on my [homepage](http://www1.spms.ntu.edu.sg/~ydchong/teaching.html).
* [jupyter/gradqm](jupyter/gradqm): accompanying numerical exercises in [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) format.

## Miscellaneous Documents

* [latex/lab](latex/lab): Latex notes on error analysis and lab report standards.
* [markov-chain-monte-carlo.ipynb](jupyter/demos/markov-chain-monte-carlo.ipynb): Jupyter notebook demonstrating the use of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to decrypt a substitution cipher.
